<v Instructor>In this lecture</v>

2
00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.600
I'd like to highlight a very important note

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.313
when it comes to website penetration testing.

4
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.900
Websites are installed on web servers on normal computers,

5
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.350
like we said before.

6
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.010
These normal computers have IP addresses,

7
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.343
and using the IP address we can access our target website.

8
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.210
Now, in many scenarios your target website,

9
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.970
or your target server

10
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.410
will contain a large number of websites,

11
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.190
so it'll have the website that you're looking for

12
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.300
that you're targeting,

13
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.060
but it'll also contain other websites on the same server,

14
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.510
so on the same file system.

15
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.170
What this means is, if you, for example,

16
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.850
could not find any vulnerabilities in your target website,

17
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.570
you can try to hack into any other website

18
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.893
that is installed in the same server.

19
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.150
If you could do that,

20
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.910
then you'll be able to gain access to the server.

21
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.270
Gaining access to the server basically means

22
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.390
you have access to all the other websites

23
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.590
because the server is just a computer

24
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.520
and you can literally just navigate

25
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.260
to the website that you want to hack

26
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.063
and gain access to that website.

27
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.300
So, if you're trying to hack into a website

28
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.760
and you couldn't find any exploits,

29
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.470
then the next step would be trying to hack any other website

30
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.030
that exists on the same server.

31
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.200
So, what I mean by exist on the same server

32
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.350
is they have the same IP address.

33
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.170
So let me show you here an example.

34
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.320
I'm gonna be showing an example of zaid.com, so my blog

35
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.060
because there is a lot of websites on the same server,

36
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.720
and if we look here on robtex.com,

37
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.940
and I came down here

38
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.890
to names pointing to the same IP address,

39
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.120
you can see all of these websites exist

40
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.550
on the same server as zaid.com.

41
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.920
So, if you could manage to hack into any of these websites,

42
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.170
you'll be able to navigate from and off that website

43
00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.860
and then into zaid.com,

44
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.023
and then gain full access to my website.

45
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:04.520
So let me just show you here.

46
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.530
If I copy any of these domain names,

47
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.240
for example, we have this one reba.me,

48
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.573
and I'm just gonna go onto my terminal.

49
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.950
Now, I've already, if I do a ping

50
00:02:22.021 --> 00:02:23.933
zaid.com,

51
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.560
you'll see that this is my IP address of my website,

52
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.330
and if I do a ping on one of the websites that exists,

53
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.670
for our use reba.me.

54
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.123
So if I go ping reba.me,

55
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.550
you'll see that both websites have the same IP address.

56
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.010
This means that both websites are installed

57
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.210
on the same computer,

58
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:48.990
and if we could hack into one of them,

59
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.890
we can literally just navigate

60
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.560
from that website into the other,

61
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.740
from our Meterpreter shell, or from our PHP shell,

62
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.853
or any type of shell that we're using.

63
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.070
Another way of finding websites

64
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.410
on the same domain is using Bing,

65
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.560
and it's a really simple way.

66
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.343
So if you just go on Bing,

67
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.290
and I'm just gonna put IP,

68
00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.830
and then I'll put the IP of my target website.

69
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.610
Again, you'll see all the other websites that exist

70
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.380
on the same server as your target website,

71
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.800
so you can literally hack into any of these websites,

72
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.870
and from there hack into my website and gain access to it.

73
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.300
This is very important because in many cases

74
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.510
your target could be very well secured,

75
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.610
but the server itself was not secure,

76
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.920
so you can manage to hack one of the other websites

77
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.003
and then navigate through the server to your target.
