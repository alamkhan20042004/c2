00:00:02.581 --> 00:00:04.160
<v Instructor>In this video, we'll see how</v>

2
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.340
we can get comprehensive DNS information

3
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.030
about the target website.

4
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.610
So just to give you a quick refresh on what DNS is,

5
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.520
so when you type in facebook.com,

6
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.650
a DNS server will convert that name to an IP address.

7
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.240
Now, the process is a bit more complicated.

8
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.030
So the DNS server contains actually a number of records

9
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.030
each pointing to a different domain or to a different IP,

10
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.310
sometimes to the same IP.

11
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.310
So but in general, you request a domain name,

12
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.220
it gets converted to an IP address, and depending on that,

13
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.020
these information needs to be stored somewhere.

14
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.310
So we're gonna query this DNS server

15
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.923
and see what information we can get through it.

16
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.500
Now we're gonna use a website called Robtext.com.

17
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.730
And I'm just gonna put the target website

18
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.150
that I want to get information about.

19
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.100
So I'm gonna type isecurity.org.

20
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.563
And I'm gonna hit Enter to get a report.

21
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.010
Now, as you can see, we will get a big report.

22
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.330
So there is a lot of information in here.

23
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.950
But you can actually use the buttons in here

24
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.170
to navigate to any of the sections below.

25
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.570
So if you wanna directly go to the records

26
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.100
or to go to the SEO, all you have to do is

27
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.843
just click in here and you'll go directly to that section.

28
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.390
What we're gonna do right now though,

29
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.060
we'll go over all the sections one by one

30
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.793
and see what kind of information we got.

31
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.510
Now keep in mind, the order of this information

32
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.243
might be different, but you should have the same sections.

33
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.580
So, and the analysis, you can see

34
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.730
we have general information about the target.

35
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.800
So you can see that it's telling us that Isecurity

36
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.220
has three name servers, five mail servers,

37
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.540
and one IP address.

38
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.140
We can see the name servers used by Isecurity.

39
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.500
And Digital Ocean is the hosting company that Isecurity

40
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.980
is using at the time of recording this lecture.

41
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.890
So this is very, very useful, because you can go

42
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.420
to Digital Ocean right now, you'll see the hosting company,

43
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.760
and then you can pretend to be them

44
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.510
and communicate with Isecurity, telling them

45
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.840
that you're signing them up for a better hosting,

46
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.260
you're giving them something because they are a VIP customer

47
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.190
and ask them to log in.

48
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.890
Obviously, they'll be logging in to a fake login page

49
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.120
and that way you'll steal their information.

50
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.370
You can tell them that there is a policy change

51
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.910
that they have to accept.

52
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.610
And again, ask them to log in

53
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.920
and steal the information that way.

54
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.910
Obviously, you'll do this through a fake login page.

55
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.340
And this is mostly social engineering,

56
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.450
so it's nothing to do with websites hacking,

57
00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.690
and I cover all this in my Social Engineering Course.

58
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.930
But it's very useful because if you couldn't hack

59
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.480
into the websites through the applications installed,

60
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.043
then the only way to get in is using social engineering.

61
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.410
Now, below this, we can see that the target

62
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.680
is using Google mail servers.

63
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.880
So they're not handling their own emails,

64
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.850
they're using Google to handle their emails.

65
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.770
Again, you can communicate with the target pretending

66
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.880
to be Google and get them to do something,

67
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.063
or to log into a fake page and steal information that way.

68
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.960
You can also see the IP address of this website,

69
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.630
which can be used to discover other websites installed

70
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.110
on the same server, and this is very, very useful

71
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.450
because if you couldn't hack into your target website

72
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.080
through the applications installed on that website,

73
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.390
then you can try to hack

74
00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.960
into any website installed on the same server.

75
00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.750
And if you manage to do that,

76
00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.060
then you You can actually navigate to your targets website,

77
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.610
because they're all essentially installed

78
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.630
on the same computer.

79
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.353
And we'll talk more about that in the next lecture.

80
00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.700
And below right here we have

81
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.200
a number of similar domains to our target.

82
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.500
Now, these might be completely irrelevant,

83
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.640
but you can have a look and see what you have.

84
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.800
Navigating to the Quick Info, again you can see

85
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.600
the domain name, you can see the TLD.

86
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.410
We have the IP address, the name servers.

87
00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.440
Again like I said, they're useful

88
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.780
because they usually give us information

89
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.720
about the domain hosting company

90
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.270
or the hosting company hosting the website itself.

91
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.980
And we also have the mail servers

92
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.430
like we seen before, it's Google Mail.

93
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.453
So that all can be really really useful.

94
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.540
The reverse section will perform Reverse DNS Lookup.

95
00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.430
So as I said at the start of the lecture,

96
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.430
DNS is used to translate domain names into IP addresses.

97
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.520
And a Reverse Lookup, we use the IP address

98
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.740
to see which domains link to this IP address.

99
00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.440
And like I said previously, this can be very, very useful,

100
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.660
because we'll be able to discover other websites hosted

101
00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.970
on the same server, and we can hack into

102
00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.240
any of these websites

103
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.280
and from there gain access to our target.

104
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.500
But with the Reverse Lookup, you won't always get

105
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.470
all the websites installed on the same server.

106
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.320
Therefore, in the next lecture,

107
00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.650
I will show you a better way of doing that.

108
00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.530
But if you really wanna see the the results

109
00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.100
of the Reverse Lookup, you'll have to log in.

110
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.150
So I'm actually gonna open a new tab,

111
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.123
I'm gonna go to Robtext again.

112
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.480
And I'm gonna click on login right here.

113
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.290
And the only way to login to Robtext right now

114
00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.453
is through Google, so gonna click on Google,

115
00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.343
I'm gonna click my email.

116
00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.440
And that's it, we're logged in.

117
00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.940
So I'm gonna close this.

118
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.563
And we're gonna refresh in here.

119
00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:19.890
And if we scroll down again to the Reverse, right here,

120
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.450
we have the results of the Reverse Lookup.

121
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.380
And you can either download this as a CSV

122
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.580
or view it as HTML.

123
00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.383
So I'm gonna choose to view it as HTML in a new tab.

124
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.860
And right here, as you can see, we only have Zsecurity

125
00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.770
on its own, because Zsecurity

126
00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.970
is hosted on its own server.

127
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.570
So there are no other websites installed on the same server.

128
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:51.530
But like I said, if there are other websites hosted

129
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.320
on the same server, then you'll be able to see them

130
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.333
in here in the Reverse Lookup.

131
00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.480
Now going down, we can see

132
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:03.000
a more detailed breakdown of the DNS records.

133
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.960
So you can see here we have information about the A record.

134
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.330
And this is the record that's used to translate

135
00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.220
the domain name into an IP address.

136
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:18.220
So you can see that isecurity.org links to this IP address,

137
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.640
which is the IP address of the server hosting

138
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.713
or containing the files of the website.

139
00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.790
Scrolling down, we have more SEO information

140
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.263
Search Engine Optimization info,

141
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:36.180
we have the web trust reputation of this website,

142
00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.173
we have the Alexa ranking.

143
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:43.930
In the share tab, we have the IP of the target website.

144
00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.640
Again, like I said, we can use this

145
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.970
to get websites installed on the same server.

146
00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.950
We have a graph representation

147
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:54.100
of all the information we gathered.

148
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.140
We also have a history section,

149
00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:00.040
this is actually very, very useful because you can use this

150
00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.160
to track all the changes to the DNS info

151
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.790
of the target website.

152
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.880
So you can see when they started using Google,

153
00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.700
you can see when they started using Digital Ocean

154
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.710
as their hosting provider.

155
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:18.110
So if we scroll down, we might actually be able to see

156
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:20.900
that they were using a different provider.

157
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.040
And here you go, we can see that they were using

158
00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.780
a different hosting company.

159
00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:29.070
This one right here, Dimofinf,

160
00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.320
I hope I'm pronouncing that right.

161
00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:35.090
But right now, as we can see, they changed and they switched

162
00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:38.150
to a different hosting company, Digital Ocean.

163
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:41.180
So again, you can even contact them pretending

164
00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:44.010
to be this company, and tell them

165
00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:46.700
that you're gonna sign them up for a better offer

166
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:50.750
or pretend that they violated one of your terms

167
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:54.312
and conditions, and ask them to login to do something.

168
00:08:54.312 --> 00:08:57.670
When they login, you can serve them a fake file,

169
00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:00.910
a backdoor or again use the login information,

170
00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:03.010
get them to login through our fake web page

171
00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:05.360
and steal the username and password.

172
00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.390
So, information is always very, very useful

173
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.270
when it comes to hacking,

174
00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:14.930
especially if you wanna perform a social engineering attack,

175
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:18.790
which might be your last resort if you could not hack

176
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:22.593
into the website using the applications installed on it.

177
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.920
Scrolling down we can see we have the Whois information,

178
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.640
we had a full lecture on how to get this

179
00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.190
and how this can be useful.

180
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:37.480
And finally, we have the DNS block information,

181
00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:42.430
which basically is a list of websites known to send spam.

182
00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:45.560
So usually email sent from these websites

183
00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.203
would be blocked or considered as spam.

184
00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:52.950
So as you can see a very useful website that can be used

185
00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:56.610
to get information about the server used

186
00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:00.100
to host the target website and its relationship

187
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.810
with other websites, other servers.

188
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:05.550
Which hosting companies are being used.

189
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:08.660
And like I said, all of this can be very, very useful

190
00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.260
whether you want to target the website itself,

191
00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.170
whether you wanna target other websites

192
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:15.640
so you can hack into your target website.

193
00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:19.860
And even if you want to social engineer one of the admins

194
00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:22.423
to gain access to your target website.
