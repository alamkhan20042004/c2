00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:02.683
<v Instructor>Today we're going</v>

2
00:00:02.683 --> 00:00:04.900
to learn how to get information

3
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.023
about the technologies used by the target website.

4
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.330
So we're going to use a website called Netcraft

5
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.470
and I'm gonna put my target here and as you can see,

6
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.160
I already put it there, isecurity.org.

7
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.620
So, I'm just gonna hit enter and again,

8
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.860
first of all you'll see some basic information,

9
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.520
such as the website title,

10
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.590
the description, the key words

11
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.823
and when the website was created.

12
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.960
Scrolling down, you'll see the website itself,

13
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.100
the domain name, the IP address,

14
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.650
just like we've seen in the previous video,

15
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.333
the domain registerer,

16
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:41.950
so the company who registered the domain

17
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.320
for us, for iSecurity

18
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.800
and you'll also see information about the organization.

19
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.180
An here, you can't see it for this example

20
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.210
because iSecurity is using privacy protection,

21
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.950
but usually you'll be able to see it

22
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.940
and see more information.

23
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.610
We can also see that it's hosted in Netherlands.

24
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:01.950
We can see the name server,

25
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.633
which is dimofinf.net.

26
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.490
And again, if you just got to dimofinf.net,

27
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.810
you'll discover that this is a website for web hosting,

28
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.320
so we know this is a web hosting company.

29
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.040
In worst case scenarios,

30
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.470
we can use this or try to hack into Dimofinf itself

31
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.313
to gain access to iSecurity.

32
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.270
Scrolling down, you'll see history of the hosting companies

33
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.040
that iSecurity used

34
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.470
and we can see that the latest one is this one.

35
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.240
And it's running on Linux with Apache.

36
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.890
Same server that we see in the previous video, 2.3.31

37
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.760
with Unix mod_ssl and all the other items.

38
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.000
Again, this is very important to find vulnerabilities

39
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.793
and exploits on our target computer.

40
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.810
In the Security section,

41
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.630
you'll see if the website has any spam

42
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.280
and you can see that it doesn't really have any spam.

43
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.690
Scrolling down on the Web Trackers,

44
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.150
it'll show you the third party resources

45
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.150
or applications used on our target.

46
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.242
So we can see that our target uses Google Analytics,

47
00:02:08.242 --> 00:02:11.370
Googlecdn, and other Google services.

48
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.954
So this could also help us to find or gain access

49
00:02:14.954 --> 00:02:16.593
to the target computer.

50
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.700
The technologies is one of the most important tabs,

51
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.620
or sections, in here

52
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.043
'cause it shows us the technologies used

53
00:02:24.043 --> 00:02:25.580
on the target website.

54
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.610
So we can see it's using Apache web server,

55
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:28.723
we already know that.

56
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.643
On Server-Side, we can see that the website uses PHP,

57
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.800
so this means the website can run,

58
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.420
can understand and run PHP code.

59
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.500
This is very important because in the future,

60
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.670
if we manage to run any kind of code on our target,

61
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.580
then we know this code should be sent as PHP code.

62
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.000
So if we're creating payloads in Metasploit

63
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.720
or even Veil-Evasion,

64
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.280
we should create them in PHP format

65
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.160
and the target website will be able to run them

66
00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.297
because it can support PHP.

67
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.700
On the Client-Side,

68
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.480
we can see that the website supports JavaScript

69
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.610
so if run JavaScript or if you manage

70
00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.230
to run JavaScript code on the website,

71
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.740
it's not going to be executed on the website.

72
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.290
It'll be executed on the users who see the website

73
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.490
because JavaScript is a client-side language

74
00:03:22.765 --> 00:03:26.220
and PHP is a server-side.

75
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.770
So if we manage to run PHP code,

76
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.690
it'll be executed on the server itself.

77
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.830
If you manage to run JavaScript,

78
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.180
it's gonna be executed on the users

79
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.203
or the people who visit the website.

80
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.390
Same here with jQuery,

81
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.703
this is just a framework for JavaScript.

82
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.960
Scrolling down, we can see that the website uses WordPress.

83
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.070
This is very important.

84
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.070
So Netcraft will also show you any web applications

85
00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.980
being used on the website.

86
00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.970
So WordPress is just a web application,

87
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.430
so you can see other examples in your case.

88
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.520
And it's a open-source web application

89
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.110
that a lot of other websites might have.

90
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.170
The good thing about this is you can go and find exploits

91
00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.350
or vulnerabilities within this web application.

92
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.090
If you are lucky enough to find an existing one,

93
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.963
then you can go ahead and exploit it on the target website.

94
00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.780
So for example, we have WordPress in our example

95
00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.630
and I'm gonna go to Exploit Database.

96
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.283
And if we go on the search here,

97
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.380
so I'm just gonna type in WordPress here.

98
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.243
And I'm gonna say I'm not a robot.

99
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.223
Then we're going to search.

100
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.500
And as you can see,

101
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.960
we managed to find a lot of exploits related to WordPress.

102
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.450
Now these are related to different versions of WordPress

103
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.700
so you need to make sure that you have the same version

104
00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.950
on your target.

105
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.700
And we'll have examples to see how

106
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.240
to use exploits like these,

107
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.063
but it just shows you how powerful information gathering is.

108
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.620
Again going down, you can see that the website uses cPanel.

109
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.750
This is another web application.

110
00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.400
It's a hosting control panel.

111
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.560
Again, you can go on Exploit Database

112
00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.560
and see if you can find any vulnerabilities

113
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.283
or exploits related to it.

114
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.470
And you can also find other information

115
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.390
such as that the website uses HTML5, uses CSS,

116
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.110
and all that kind of stuff.

117
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.560
So Netcraft is really useful.

118
00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.210
From it we managed to know that the website runs PHP,

119
00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:37.878
it runs JavaScript,

120
00:05:37.878 --> 00:05:39.100
it uses WordPress,

121
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.700
so we can use WordPress to hack into the website,

122
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.050
and cPanel.

123
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.140
And we can also, if we go up,

124
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.230
we also manage to know the web hosting,

125
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.520
or even we found out in the previous video,

126
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.220
that Dimofinf is the web hosting company of this website,

127
00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.220
so in worst case scenarios,

128
00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.660
we can try to hack into that web hosting

129
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.193
and gain access to our target website.
