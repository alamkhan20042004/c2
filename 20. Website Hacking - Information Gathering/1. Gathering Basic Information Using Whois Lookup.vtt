1
00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:03.750
<v Instructor>As usual, the first thing that we do</v>

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.860
before we start trying to exploit

3
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.870
or find any vulnerabilities,

4
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.250
we do information gathering,

5
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.890
so we try to gather as much information as possible

6
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:13.238
about the target.

7
00:00:13.238 --> 00:00:15.760
Web applications are no different,

8
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.109
so we're going to start

9
00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:20.730
by trying to get as much information as we can

10
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.858
about the target IP address,

11
00:00:22.858 --> 00:00:26.850
the domain name info, the technologies used on the websites,

12
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.810
so what programming languages used,

13
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.989
what kind of server is installed on it,

14
00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.012
what kind of database is being used.

15
00:00:34.012 --> 00:00:36.830
We're going to gather information about the company,

16
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.290
the DNS records and we'll also see if we can find

17
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.710
any files that are not being listed

18
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.803
or any sub domains that are not visible to other people.

19
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.560
Now you can use any of the information gathering tools

20
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.673
that we used before.

21
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.320
For example, you can use Maltego

22
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.560
and just insert an entity, as a website.

23
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.110
And then start running actions to our transformers

24
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.490
just like we seen in the Maltego video.

25
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:05.730
I'm not gonna be explaining that

26
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.270
because it is exactly the same

27
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.140
as we did it with a normal person,

28
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.950
so I'm gonna be skipping through that.

29
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.870
You can also use Zenmap like we did before

30
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.700
or even Nexpose and test the infrastructure of the website

31
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.730
and see what information you can gather from that.

32
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.240
Again, I won't be going over that because we seen it.

33
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.060
There's no difference between a website or normal computer

34
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.800
as I said a website just another computer.

35
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.905
So what I'm gonna be focusing on

36
00:01:29.905 --> 00:01:33.200
is technologies that you only see in websites

37
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.200
such as domain names, DNS records and stuff like that,

38
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.470
that you won't be able to use or we haven't seen before

39
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:42.633
in the previous videos.

40
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.380
So, the first thing that we're going to have a look on,

41
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.763
is Whois Lookup.

42
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.405
Whois Lookup is a protocol that's used

43
00:01:52.405 --> 00:01:55.920
to find owners of internet resources.

44
00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.720
For example, server, an IP address or domain.

45
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.930
So we're actually not hacking or doing anything,

46
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.110
we're literally just retrieving info from a database

47
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.620
that contains information about owners of stuff

48
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.483
on the internet.

49
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.350
So for example, when you sign up for a domain name,

50
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.030
if you wanted to register a domain name for yourself,

51
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.390
for example z.com, when I do that

52
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.850
I have to supply information about myself,

53
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.860
my address and then the name will be stored in my own name

54
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.290
and people can see that z owns this domain name.

55
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.430
So this is all we're going to do.

56
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.820
If you google Whois Lookup you'll see a lot of websites

57
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.330
providing the service,

58
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.890
so I'm using whois.domaintools.com,

59
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.010
and I'm just gonna put my target domain name,

60
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.103
and I'm just gonna use isecurity.org.

61
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.990
So as you can see very simple,

62
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.083
and we get a lot of information about our target website.

63
00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.090
You'll see the email that you can use

64
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.630
to contact the domain name info,

65
00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.750
usually you'll be able to see the address of the company

66
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.780
that has registered this domain name,

67
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.510
but we can see that this company is using privacy

68
00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.700
on their domain so you can't really see the address,

69
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.100
but they're not using privacy,

70
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.100
you'll be able to see their address

71
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.380
and more information about the actual company.

72
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.713
You can see when the domain name was created,

73
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.440
you can see the IP address of isecurity.org,

74
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.940
so if you pinged this, you should get this IP address

75
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:32.840
and I'll show you.

76
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.357
If I do ping isecurity.org,

77
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.410
you'll see it's the same domain name here,

78
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.943
same IP address here sorry.

79
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.280
You can see the IP location, we can see the status

80
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.763
obviously it's active.

81
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.720
You can also access the history

82
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.463
but you need to register for that.

83
00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.480
And obviously we can see the title here

84
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.340
and something that's very useful here,

85
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.670
we can see that it's using apache web server,

86
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.220
so this is a software that can be used as a web server,

87
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.670
and we can see that Isecurity uses this web server

88
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.740
and it's of version 2.2.31,

89
00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.274
so again we can use this to find exploits,

90
00:04:18.274 --> 00:04:21.530
we can see that it's using Unix,

91
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.320
the operating system of the website of the server

92
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.900
and it's using the following add-ons as well,

93
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.120
it's using mod ssl and open ssl.

94
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.750
Now right here, you can find more information

95
00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.560
about the company who registered this domain,

96
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.260
so again Isecurity is using privacy

97
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.640
so you won't be able to see the address,

98
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.330
you can see that it's saying that the target person

99
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.663
is using a privacy protection.

100
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.270
But usually you'll be able to see phone numbers

101
00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.193
and addresses of that company.

102
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.960
So as you can see very simple stuff

103
00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.590
but it's very helpful in the long run

104
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.696
just to know what your target, what's their IP,

105
00:05:00.696 --> 00:05:02.870
what services are they using,

106
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.450
we can also here actually I didn't show

107
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.490
you can see the name servers that are being used

108
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.620
and you can see that they are provided

109
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.280
by a company called dimnof.net.

110
00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.460
Now if you go on dimnof,

111
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.593
you'll see that this is a hosting company.

112
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.510
So if we go on the english version,

113
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.410
that you'll see that this is a hosting company

114
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.470
and again you can even use this hosting company

115
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.708
and try to social engineer your way maybe

116
00:05:30.708 --> 00:05:34.163
into hacking into your target, into Isecurity.
