00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:02.810
<v Instructor>So, we can see here from the result,</v>

2
00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.350
it was able to find a number of files.

3
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.010
Some of them we already know of.

4
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.780
Now the favicon is just an icon.

5
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.200
Footer and header, these are probably only style files.

6
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.300
Index is the index that we see usually,

7
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.760
so it's all right.

8
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.200
Login, we can see that we discovered a page

9
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.060
that allows people to login.

10
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.510
Now, in many scenarios I was able to find username

11
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:24.970
and password of our target,

12
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.970
exploiting a really complex exploit.

13
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.160
And then ending up not being able to login

14
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.120
'cause I couldn't find where to login.

15
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.600
So tools like this could be very useful.

16
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.420
And here we can see that we have a login page

17
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.763
that we can use to login.

18
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.320
Page not found, not very useful.

19
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.140
You can see the PHP info file.

20
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.800
Now this file is usually very, very useful,

21
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.610
because it displays a lot of information about

22
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.210
the PHP interpreter running on the web server.

23
00:00:55.996 --> 00:00:57.892
And as you can see, this file contains

24
00:00:57.892 --> 00:00:59.236
a lot of information.

25
00:00:59.236 --> 00:01:00.620
A lot of them are useful now.

26
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.128
You get to know some of the directories.

27
00:01:04.128 --> 00:01:06.420
You know that it's running PHP 5.

28
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.903
The configuration is stored in this file.

29
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.660
INI files is usually the config files for PHPs.

30
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.883
So you can see all the places where they're stored.

31
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.130
And going down you'll see all

32
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.033
the permissions, the installed.

33
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.330
We can see here it has MySQL.

34
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.000
So it's using MySQL.

35
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.620
And you can see the directories where different types

36
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.700
of configurations are stored.

37
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.270
You can also see all the modules

38
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.200
and extensions that are being used with PHP.

39
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.803
So this file is usually very, very useful.

40
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.990
You can see we managed to find

41
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.310
where the phpMyAdmin login is,

42
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.690
and that's basically the login that's used

43
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.393
to login to the database.

44
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.450
Another very useful file is the robots.txt.

45
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.290
And that is the file that tells search engines,

46
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.090
such as Google, how to deal with the website.

47
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.850
So it usually contains files that

48
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.890
we don't want the website or Google

49
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.700
to see or to read.

50
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.000
So if we can read that file,

51
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.810
then we'll be able to see what

52
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.843
the web admin is trying to hide.

53
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.690
So go in in here, we can see that

54
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.290
the web admin doesn't want Google

55
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.703
to see a directory called passwords.

56
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.090
Okay, and it also doesn't want it to see

57
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.123
a file called config.inc.

58
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.300
And it also doesn't want it see these other files.

59
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.730
So let's have a look on the passwords

60
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.430
and the config.inc as examples.

61
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.453
So I'm just going to open a new tab,

62
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.253
and we're going to put our address like so.

63
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:52.910
So it's the current directory and

64
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.623
then we just put passwords after.

65
00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.663
In that we can see that there's a file called accounts.txt.

66
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.580
And going here, we can see that

67
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.950
we got some usernames and passwords.

68
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.500
So we can see there is admin, adminPass.

69
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.530
We can see that we have a password

70
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.293
as Adrian and some password.

71
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.360
So we managed to find usernames and passwords.

72
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.550
Now we're still not sure what

73
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.380
these usernames and passwords for,

74
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.710
but we're sure that we were able

75
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.423
to find very useful stuff.

76
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.693
Another useful file is the config.inc.

77
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.143
So let's see what's in that.

78
00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.500
And from here we can see that we have information

79
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.870
that allows to connect

80
00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.450
to the database, because these are saying

81
00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.490
dbhouse, dbuser, dbpass, and name.

82
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.610
So we can see that the username is root

83
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.520
and the password is blank.

84
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.470
So we can go ahead and try to connect

85
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.310
to the database, based on these commands,

86
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.593
and then we should be able to get access to that database.

87
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.470
Also, using these passwords, we're still

88
00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.270
not sure what we can use them for,

89
00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.570
but we can add them to a list,

90
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.220
try to login to the admin.

91
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.510
Or just store them in a list so

92
00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.160
that we can use it if we're going

93
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.610
to do any brute force attack.

94
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.720
So then again, this is another video

95
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.390
that just shows how important

96
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.113
and powerful information gathering can be.
