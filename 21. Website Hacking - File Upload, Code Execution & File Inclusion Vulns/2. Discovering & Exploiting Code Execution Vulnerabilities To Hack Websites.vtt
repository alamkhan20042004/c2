<v Narrator>Code Execution Vulnerabilities.</v>

2
00:00:03.807 --> 00:00:06.407
These type of vulnerabilities allow us to execute

3
00:00:06.407 --> 00:00:09.389
operating system code on the target server.

4
00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.579
So, if the target server uses Windows,

5
00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:13.334
we'll be able to execute Windows command,

6
00:00:13.334 --> 00:00:17.000
if it uses Linux, then we'll be able to use Linux commands.

7
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.772
Clearly, this is a really critical problem,

8
00:00:20.772 --> 00:00:23.444
that would allow us to do anything we want

9
00:00:23.444 --> 00:00:25.120
with the target, really.

10
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.623
We can upload a PHP shell,

11
00:00:26.623 --> 00:00:30.840
using wget command or upload a payload,

12
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.135
a virus, anything we want,

13
00:00:32.135 --> 00:00:35.131
using the wget Linux command.

14
00:00:35.131 --> 00:00:37.213
You just need to make sure that you're uploading it

15
00:00:37.213 --> 00:00:39.185
to a file or to a directory,

16
00:00:39.185 --> 00:00:41.201
which you're allowed to write stuff to.

17
00:00:41.201 --> 00:00:44.154
Another way of exploiting this vulnerability,

18
00:00:44.154 --> 00:00:48.448
is, to just run OS commands and get a reverse shield

19
00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:50.280
based on these commands.

20
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.970
So, because we can run operating system commands,

21
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.210
we can use the programming languages supported

22
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.523
by that operating system to try and get

23
00:00:58.523 --> 00:01:01.113
a reverse connection on our computer.

24
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.360
So, first of all, let's just assume

25
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.571
that we're browsing here,

26
00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:09.507
and we manage to we're going around

27
00:01:09.507 --> 00:01:13.214
and then we got to a tab in the website

28
00:01:13.214 --> 00:01:15.460
where it allows you to,

29
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.920
for example do a ping.

30
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.614
Now what you should do is, you should always

31
00:01:18.614 --> 00:01:22.048
try to experiment with any input works you see.

32
00:01:22.048 --> 00:01:25.020
Try to see what that input works does

33
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.051
and what can you inject into it,

34
00:01:27.051 --> 00:01:30.038
what can you do to get stuff running.

35
00:01:30.038 --> 00:01:32.070
So, for example, this input works

36
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.030
is telling you its going to do a ping.

37
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.310
And, if you put an IP,

38
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.400
for example I'm going to put 10 20 14 203,

39
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.524
which is my own IP.

40
00:01:39.524 --> 00:01:42.239
Just to see it, to use it as a normal person,

41
00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:45.560
I'm going to do a submit and it's going to go ahead

42
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.750
and ping it for me and give me the ping results.

43
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.120
So, what looks like here,

44
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.593
it's actually executing the ping command,

45
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:54.970
in Linux systems.

46
00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.400
Now, let's see if we can exploit that.

47
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.100
If it's actually executing the ping command.

48
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.815
So, what it's doing is, it's going,

49
00:02:01.815 --> 00:02:03.793
and it's doing.

50
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.780
So, we're sending 10 20 14 203 as the ping.

51
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.039
And then it's going to the web server

52
00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:16.607
and the web server is doing ping, 10 20 14 203.

53
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.930
So, let's see if we can exploit this.

54
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.153
How would we exploit it?

55
00:02:23.153 --> 00:02:25.364
It's taken what we're inputting, right here.

56
00:02:25.364 --> 00:02:28.819
And then, it's doing ping, that.

57
00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.966
Now, in Linux and Unix based commands

58
00:02:32.966 --> 00:02:37.966
you can use, the, this sign to execute multiple commands,

59
00:02:38.978 --> 00:02:40.630
on one line.

60
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.270
So, if you do this, for example in your own terminal,

61
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.570
so, I'm just going to go through my terminal, here.

62
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.640
And I'm just going to do LS, which is the list command

63
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.884
and then PWD is what lists,

64
00:02:51.884 --> 00:02:54.220
what shows your working directory.

65
00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.096
So, if I do an LS, followed by this sign

66
00:02:57.096 --> 00:03:00.829
and then do PWD, it will execute both commands.

67
00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.560
So, it will do this and then it will show

68
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.021
where the working directory is.

69
00:03:05.021 --> 00:03:08.180
So, we can do the same thing with this

70
00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.820
and see if it works for us.

71
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.268
So, we're going to put in IP, a right IP,

72
00:03:12.268 --> 00:03:13.975
and then I'm just going to do PWD

73
00:03:13.975 --> 00:03:17.499
and see if it will execute the PWD for me.

74
00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:19.030
If it does,

75
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.969
then this is a code execution vulnerability

76
00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:24.710
and I can execute anything I want on the server.

77
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.040
So, let's see what's going to happen.

78
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.563
I pasted this, and I'm going to hit submit.

79
00:03:29.863 --> 00:03:32.072
And as you can see, we got the ping results,

80
00:03:32.072 --> 00:03:33.950
but at the end,

81
00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.750
we got our current working directory.

82
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.777
So, its via wwwdvwa vulnerability is an exec.

83
00:03:41.996 --> 00:03:46.024
So, it executed the PWD that I inserted.

84
00:03:46.024 --> 00:03:48.970
And that means I can insert any commands I want,

85
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.663
in there and they'll be executed.

86
00:03:51.663 --> 00:03:54.956
So, I've inserted a resources file

87
00:03:54.956 --> 00:03:59.253
that you can use to get reverse connection

88
00:03:59.253 --> 00:04:01.570
from the target computer.

89
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:02.860
Now, there's a number of ways,

90
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.550
a number of commands that would give you

91
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:05.880
a reverse connection.

92
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.330
All of these commands depend on the programming language.

93
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.592
So, for example, we have commands in PHP,

94
00:04:10.592 --> 00:04:13.304
we have commands in Ruby, you have Pearl commands

95
00:04:13.304 --> 00:04:15.070
and we have the one for Bash.

96
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.070
Bash is the Linux shell command and language.

97
00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:23.707
So, all Unix operating systems will be able to execute

98
00:04:23.707 --> 00:04:25.170
Bash commands.

99
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.670
So, that's a very good way of doing it.

100
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.160
So, most Unix system,

101
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.204
this command should work on most Unix based systems.

102
00:04:35.204 --> 00:04:37.587
So, this would be a really good way of doing it.

103
00:04:37.587 --> 00:04:39.613
Again, most of them would have Python,

104
00:04:39.613 --> 00:04:41.458
so, Python would be a good way.

105
00:04:41.458 --> 00:04:44.248
Netcat, most of them do have Netcat as well.

106
00:04:44.248 --> 00:04:46.158
So, Netcat is a good way of doing that.

107
00:04:46.158 --> 00:04:50.200
And, we're actually going to use Netcat in this video.

108
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.850
So, what I'm going to do is,

109
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.610
first I'm going to listen for connections,

110
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.470
just like we used to do with Metasploit,

111
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.520
when we used to do multihandler.

112
00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.333
You can actually use a multihandler for this,

113
00:04:59.333 --> 00:05:00.661
and listen for a connection.

114
00:05:00.661 --> 00:05:02.730
Well, I'm just going to keep it simpler

115
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.240
and show you a new way.

116
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.450
And, I'm going to use Netcat.

117
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:06.763
So, Netcat.

118
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.400
Netcat is just a tool that allows you

119
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.023
to listen and connect computers together.

120
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.797
So, I'm going to listen on port 80 80.

121
00:05:18.797 --> 00:05:20.410
So, Netcat is the program.

122
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.440
vv is just to see verbose output,

123
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.020
so we can see a lot of output,

124
00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.381
anything goes wrong, we can see it.

125
00:05:25.381 --> 00:05:27.580
And, we're telling it to listen,

126
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.203
using the L option on port 8080.

127
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.570
So, I'm going to hit enter,

128
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.430
and that's saying just listening on port 8080,

129
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.824
that's all it's going to do.

130
00:05:36.824 --> 00:05:39.920
The next command we're going to do, is,

131
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.536
we're going to try to connect from the web server

132
00:05:42.536 --> 00:05:45.950
back to my computer, using Netcat, as well.

133
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.934
So, we're assuming the web server has Netcat.

134
00:05:47.934 --> 00:05:49.811
We're going to try it and see if that works.

135
00:05:49.811 --> 00:05:51.930
So, the command is very simple.

136
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.968
It's Netcat and we're telling it to use bin bash.

137
00:05:54.968 --> 00:05:59.503
And we're giving it the IP of my device.

138
00:05:59.503 --> 00:06:03.613
My attacker device, which is 10 20 14.

139
00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.300
And, then the port which is 8080.

140
00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.988
Which is where we're listening on, right here.

141
00:06:11.988 --> 00:06:14.063
So, I'm going to copy that.

142
00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.550
And I'm just going to execute it the same way

143
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:18.394
we used to execute the PWD

144
00:06:18.394 --> 00:06:21.183
command.

145
00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.587
So, the last thing we did, was, 10 20 14 203.

146
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.400
And then we did PWD.

147
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.340
So, what I'm going to do now,

148
00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.020
I'm going to remove the PWD

149
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.383
and paste the code that we just created,

150
00:06:39.383 --> 00:06:42.401
which we'll try to connect from the web server

151
00:06:42.401 --> 00:06:45.313
back to the cally machine to the attacker machine.

152
00:06:45.313 --> 00:06:47.510
And, I'm going to come here.

153
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.363
And, as you can see, we got a connection back

154
00:06:50.363 --> 00:06:54.794
from, to us, from 10 20 14 204.

155
00:06:54.794 --> 00:06:57.434
So, that's the tarried computer.

156
00:06:57.434 --> 00:07:00.773
And, if we do a PWD, you'll see that we have

157
00:07:00.773 --> 00:07:02.802
a reverse shell if we do an LS.

158
00:07:02.802 --> 00:07:07.607
If we do an ID, you'll see that we're wwwdata

159
00:07:07.607 --> 00:07:11.534
and you're free to (mumbles) you name A, just to confirm.

160
00:07:11.534 --> 00:07:14.690
That I'm in the Metasploitable and you can see

161
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.260
that I'm in the Metasploitable.

162
00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.970
And, I'm able to run any command that I want

163
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:19.803
on the target computer.

164
00:07:19.803 --> 00:07:23.393
So, basically I have full access to the target computer.
