00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.810
<v Instructor>Now from the previous lectures,</v>

2
00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.040
we know, once we connect to a network, it's game over

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.560
because, once connected, we can run an ARP spoofing attack

4
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.760
to redirect the flow of packets

5
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.630
so that they go through our computer.

6
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.110
This allow us to become the man in the middle,

7
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.060
and once we're the man in the middle,

8
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.270
we can run so many dangerous and effective attacks.

9
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.560
So we can spy on all the users, steal their passwords,

10
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.920
redirect them to different websites,

11
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.920
and this is all just a small taste of what you can do.

12
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.250
You'll actually see us build on this

13
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.580
in the client side attack section,

14
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.300
where we're going to completely hack into computers

15
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.110
connected to the same network as us.

16
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.890
And if you go and do my Advanced Network Hacking course,

17
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.050
then you'll see more advanced attacks

18
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.180
that'll allow us to do so many cool stuff on the network.

19
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.760
Again, all of this is possible because, once we connect,

20
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.103
we can run ARP spoofing and become the man in the middle.

21
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.640
Now, in this section, I actually want to show you

22
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.790
another method that'll allow us

23
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.380
to become the man in the middle.

24
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.240
And once we're the man in the middle,

25
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.320
we'll be able to run all of the attacks

26
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.270
that you've seen so far and all of the other man

27
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.970
in the middle attacks that you'll learn in the future.

28
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.010
So let's go back to the first diagram

29
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.770
that we learned in this course

30
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.300
when we were talking about how networks work in general.

31
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.600
We said the only device that has access to the internet

32
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.520
is the access point, and whenever a client

33
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.140
wants to access something,

34
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.300
they send the request to the access point.

35
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.530
The access point goes to the internet,

36
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.273
gets the response and send it back to the client.

37
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.590
Now what if we replace this access point

38
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.620
with our hacker computer?

39
00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.160
So what if we can use our machine

40
00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.160
to create a wifi network that actually has internet access

41
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.080
so people will actually try to come in

42
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.163
and connect to our network to access the internet,

43
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.740
and then, when they connect to our network,

44
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.460
by default we will be the man in the middle

45
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.090
because we are the router?

46
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.220
So we won't really need to exploit anything.

47
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.680
We are automatically the man in the middle,

48
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.810
and the clients will automatically send us any requests

49
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.210
because they want to access the internet,

50
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.950
and we will see these requests, obviously,

51
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.960
go to the internet, get them what they want

52
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.310
and give it back to them.

53
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.810
This way, we'll be able to launch all of the attacks

54
00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.670
that I showed you previously

55
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.160
without the need to exploit the ARP protocol,

56
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.530
so without the need to run ARP spoofing.

57
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.180
All we'll have to do, once our network is running

58
00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.890
and we have clients connected,

59
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.863
we can just start sniffing using Wireshark or Bettercap.

60
00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.090
So for this to work, you need a computer,

61
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.560
and we already have our hacker computer with Kali Linux.

62
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.500
You also need internet access,

63
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.870
and you need a wireless device

64
00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.780
that's going to broadcast the wifi signal

65
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.490
and tell all the neighboring devices that I am a network,

66
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.513
you can come in and connect to me.

67
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.310
So you will need, first of all, an interface

68
00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.610
that has internet connection.

69
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.870
This interface, it can be a wifi interface

70
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.470
connected to the internet.

71
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.280
It could be an ethernet interface

72
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.410
connected to an ethernet network.

73
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.840
It could be a 3G or a 4G dongle,

74
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.660
and it even can be a virtual interface,

75
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.010
and this is what I'm actually going to do.

76
00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.200
It's going to be my ETA zero, the virtual interface

77
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.920
that is connected to my network.

78
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.570
So this can be any network device

79
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.343
as long as it has internet access.

80
00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.840
The next interface that you will need, like I said,

81
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.740
it's gonna have to be a wifi interface

82
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.480
because it needs to be able

83
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.250
to broadcast the signal for the network.

84
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.910
And you can't use any wifi interface.

85
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.820
This interface needs to be able

86
00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.330
to act as an access point.

87
00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.220
So it needs to be capable

88
00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.220
of acting like a proper access point like a router.

89
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.210
Now, all of the wifi adapters that I recommend

90
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.380
support this mode, and I've already included a video

91
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.270
in the resources before

92
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.290
when I first spoke about wireless adapters,

93
00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.080
but I'm also gonna include this video

94
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.300
in the resources of this lecture.

95
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.910
So if you're going to buy one or if you're not sure

96
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.840
how to pick the right one, then check out this video.

97
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.623
It should be helpful for you.

98
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.270
So once we have this set up properly,

99
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.500
we can use our computer to start an access point,

100
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.300
and it's going to act exactly like a router.

101
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.870
So people will be able to see the network,

102
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.860
when they look for wifi networks.

103
00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.480
They'll be able to connect to it

104
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.730
and get internet connection.

105
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.340
But when they connect,

106
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.310
they will have to send us all of their requests

107
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.560
because we are the router, we are the access point,

108
00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.610
so by default, we will be the man in the middle.

109
00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.410
Therefore, you'll be able to execute

110
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.820
all man in the middle attacks that you learned so far

111
00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.210
and any other man in the middle attacks

112
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.423
that you will learn in the future.

113
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.240
So basically, ARP spoofing is one method

114
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.250
of becoming the man in the middle.

115
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.130
And what I'm gonna show you right now

116
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.583
is another method of becoming the man in the middle.

117
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.310
Now you can see that, in order to use our computer

118
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.230
as an access point, we need a number of components

119
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.370
to be configured properly.

120
00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.500
So first of all, we need our wireless interface

121
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.140
to broadcast the signal as if it's a real network.

122
00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.050
This will allow other clients to connect to it,

123
00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.230
but that's not the end of the road.

124
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.930
The wireless interface needs to know

125
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.780
when these clients are requesting websites.

126
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.040
It needs to be able to forward these requests

127
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.000
to the other interface that is connected to the internet.

128
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.880
Then again, it'll need to be able

129
00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.390
to know when the response has come back

130
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.223
and forward all of this to the right client.

131
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.660
Now you can configure all of these things manually,

132
00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.170
and I actually cover this

133
00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.660
in my Advanced Network Hacking course,

134
00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.040
and I cover a lot of advanced things

135
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.790
that you can do with the fake access point,

136
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.100
like launching an evil twin attack,

137
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:49.400
hacking into WPA2 Enterprise, and so on.

138
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.600
But this would take at least 30 lectures,

139
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.220
and this is not a network hacking course.

140
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.030
This is a general ethical hacking course.

141
00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.640
Therefore, that would be out of the scope of this lecture.

142
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.780
If you're interested in learning how to do this manually

143
00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:09.240
and how to run advanced attacks using the fake access point,

144
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.480
then check out my Advanced Network Hacking course

145
00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.843
in the bonus lecture, the last lecture of this course.

146
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.380
For now, for this course, I'm gonna show you

147
00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:23.730
a great way of quickly creating a fake access point

148
00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.220
that'll allow us to become the man in the middle,

149
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.023
similar to what's shown in this diagram.
