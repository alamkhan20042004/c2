00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.960 line:15% 
<v ->Okay, so now we know our target database</v>

2
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.523 line:15% 
is called owasp10.

3
00:00:08.243 --> 00:00:10.250 line:15% 
Let's try and discover the tables

4
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.750 line:15% 
that exist in that database.

5
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.950 line:15% 
So this is our select statement,

6
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.070 line:15% 
it's a union select 1 and we have these things.

7
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.230 line:15% 
So I'm gonna leave this or change these to null.

8
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.650 line:15% 
'Cause I only wanna select one thing now

9
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.760 line:15% 
and I'm gonna set this to null as well.

10
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.020 line:15% 
And in number two, we're going to select

11
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.033 line:15% 
table name

12
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:38.723 line:15% 
from.

13
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.640 line:15% 
Now we're gonna select this from

14
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.210 line:15% 
a database called Information Schema.

15
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.710 line:15% 
Now I said this in the first video of SQL,

16
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.840 line:15% 
that information schema is a default database

17
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.800 line:15% 
created by MySQL and it contains information

18
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.430 line:15% 
about all other databases.

19
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.380 line:15% 
So what we're doing now,

20
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.360 line:15% 
we're selecting the table name from information

21
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.193 line:15% 
schema dot, and after the dot, you put the table.

22
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.630 line:15% 
So basically we're selecting a table

23
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.390 line:15% 
called tables from a database called information schema.

24
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.070 line:15% 
And the column that we're selecting is called table name.

25
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.700 line:15% 
So we're selecting table name from the database

26
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.503 line:15% 
that's called information schema from the table tables.

27
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.050 line:15% 
Let's execute this and see if we can get all the tables

28
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.103
that exist in owasp10 database.

29
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.210
So we can see we got 237 records.

30
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.480
And you can see all the tables that we have,

31
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.970
so these are all the tables

32
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.053
that we have access to.

33
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.640
So again, I said, we were logged in as Root,

34
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.290
therefore we can actually see tables from

35
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.300
other web applications, such as The Tiki Wiki.

36
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.128
But in real life scenarios you'll only see tables

37
00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:12.200
related to your current database,

38
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.923
which is Mutillidae.

39
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.090 line:15% 
So what I'm going to do is, I'm going to use a where clause

40
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.420 line:15% 
and I'm gonna say where the table

41
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.480 line:15% 
schema is equal to

42
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.363
owasp10.

43
00:02:32.204 --> 00:02:35.310 line:15% 
So owasp10 was what we got when we executed,

44
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.790 line:15% 
when we selected the database, so we got owasp10,

45
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.620 line:15% 
which is our current database that Mutillidae is working on.

46
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.730 line:15% 
So we are using the same statement,

47
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.360 line:15% 
we're selecting the table name

48
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.350 line:15% 
from information schema tables,

49
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.810 line:15% 
where the table schema

50
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.133
is owasp10.

51
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.533 line:15% 
So I'm gonna copy that.

52
00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.683
And execute it here.

53
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.110
And as you can see now, we have so much less tables,

54
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.270
and we only have the ones that we're interested in.

55
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.160
So we have the accounts, the blogs, captured data,

56
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.250
credit cards, hitlog and the pen test tools.

57
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.090
Now if you remember, in the first or the second video,

58
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.756
in the SQL injection videos,

59
00:03:26.756 --> 00:03:30.690
I showed you what's the content of the OWASP table was.

60
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.753
And it was these tables of the OWASP database.
