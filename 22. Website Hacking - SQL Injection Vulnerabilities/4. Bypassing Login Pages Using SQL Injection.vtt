1
00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.280
<v Instructor>Okay, so now we know that we can put</v>

2
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.530
any code we want, in here,

3
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.080
and it's going to be executed on the system.

4
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.290
So, let's have another look now on the statement.

5
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.450
So the statement says, select * from accounts,

6
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.820
where user name is equal to the username that we put here,

7
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.240
and password is equal to the password that we put there.

8
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.130
Let's see if we can use that, to log in without using

9
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.530
a password, without even knowing the password.

10
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.160
And I'm gonna be doing that with the admin.

11
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.483
So, the admin, the username is going to be admin.

12
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.080
And I don't know what the password is for the admin.

13
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.730
So what I'm going to do, I'm just gonna put anything,

14
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.050
so nothing really, any random password,

15
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.350
And, in the code, well I should run here.

16
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.340
So were doing, and 1 = 1 and, or stuff,

17
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.770
So, what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna do or,

18
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.270
instead of and.

19
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.193
And I'm gonna say 1 = 1.

20
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.320
So, what our code is going to be, once I run this,

21
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.500
once I inject this,

22
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.730
this is going to go in here,

23
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:08.980
like we are doing before.

24
00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.380
So, our code is going to look like this,

25
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.680
so it's going to be.

26
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.110
Select * from accounts,

27
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.960
where our username is equal to admin.

28
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.820
And password is equal to AAA.

29
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:20.863
Now this is wrong.

30
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.980
Or, 1 = 1,

31
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.240
which is right.

32
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.410
So, any time you have an or, if the or condition is

33
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.550
right, everything is right.

34
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.440
That's the way or statement works.

35
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.370
So, select * from accounts.

36
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.930
We're user is equal to admin, okay,

37
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.580
username is equal to admin.

38
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.500
And password is equal to AAA, that's wrong.

39
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.860
Or 1 = 1, okay, I'll accept that.

40
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.780
And then, it's actually gonna execute it,

41
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.320
and let us log into the admin without even knowing

42
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.100
the password for the admin.

43
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.773
So let's try to inject this now.

44
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.600
And as you can see, I was able to log in, as admin,

45
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.993
and monkey is the signature for the admin.

46
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.870
Now, bypass and log in's can be done in so many ways,

47
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.400
depending on the code that's written on the page.

48
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.230
And depending on the way you wanna do it,

49
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.730
and how you're imagining the code.

50
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.490
And a lot of the cases, when you put the single quote here,

51
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.070
you won't see this message.

52
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.200
Sometimes you do see it,

53
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.150
which makes your job so much easier.

54
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.270
If you don't, then you kinda need to guess

55
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.780
what it looks like.

56
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.260
So I'm gonna show you other example of bypassing.

57
00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.363
Instead of injecting the code like this,

58
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.090
the admin parameter is actually injectable as well,

59
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.300
as you've seen when I put this single quote,

60
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.410
the admin parameter is injectable, exactly the same way

61
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.580
as the password.

62
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.260
So we can inject code in the username as well.

63
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.997
And what I going to do now, so let's have a look on this,

64
00:02:44.997 --> 00:02:47.670
and I'm just gonna reset it to the way it would usually

65
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.503
look like.

66
00:02:48.503 --> 00:02:53.000
So, we'd have and the username and the password,

67
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.590
out of the fields that you whatever you put in here,

68
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.530
are gonna be substituted and the username and the password.

69
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.660
So, let's try to inject something in the username,

70
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.490
and what I'm going to say is, I'm gonna say,

71
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.830
username is equal to admin,

72
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.380
and then I'm gonna close the quote myself,

73
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.490
and then I'm gonna add a comment.

74
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.400
So, my statement, when I run the statement,

75
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.410
it's going to look like this, and I'm actually just gonna

76
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.780
copy it here.

77
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.210
And, when I inject one, when I put this code in here,

78
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.083
in my name.

79
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.343
It's going to inject that in there,

80
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.260
so this is what the code is gonna look like.

81
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.570
It's gonna select start from accounts,

82
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.200
where username is equal to admin.

83
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.303
I closed the quote myself here, using this right there.

84
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.300
And, then I'm adding a comment, so basically,

85
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.870
all of this is not even gonna be executed,

86
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.400
so the code is gonna be this,

87
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.282
it's gonna be select * from accounts,

88
00:03:48.282 --> 00:03:50.020
where username is equal to admin.

89
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.170
And it's gonna let me log in without entering even

90
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.883
anything in the password,

91
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.083
So, let's do this.

92
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.170
I'm gonna put my username as admin,

93
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.560
and I close the quote and add a comment.

94
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.520
And then you can put any password you want to.

95
00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.520
I'm just gonna put #1,

96
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.633
then I'm gonna log in.

97
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.033
And as you can see, I managed to log in as admin.

98
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.010
So again, in this is black box testing,

99
00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.220
so you don't really see the code.

100
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.500
In many cases you wanna be playing around with it,

101
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.410
and see how it works with you.

102
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.660
But, the main thing is you wanna test if the

103
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.770
SQL injection exists, and you'd use that using the method

104
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.570
we showed you in the previous video.

105
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.300
So try a single quote, try the and statement,

106
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.550
try true and statements, so 1 = 1,

107
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.537
and then a false and statement, so 1 = 0,

108
00:04:39.537 --> 00:04:43.920
or 2 = 0, and if they work as expected,

109
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.260
then you're target has an SQL injection,

110
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.310
and you can start playing around with it.
