<v ->So, I just want to highlight</v>

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.023
why SQL Injections are so important and so dangerous.

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.220
The reason behind that is they are found,

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.530
you can find them everywhere,

5
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.150
a lot of places, a lot of big websites

6
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.130
have these kind of exploits

7
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.620
and like things like Yahoo, Google had them.

8
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.580
They are very hard to protect against

9
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.470
and it's very easy to make a mistake

10
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.563
to make these exploits available for exploitation.

11
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.260
The other reason that they're very dangerous

12
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.690
is that they give you access to the database.

13
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.240
In many scenarios, if you find an SQL Injection

14
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.037
you really don't need to upload the PHP shell

15
00:00:42.037 --> 00:00:43.810
or get a reverse connection.

16
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.980
There is really no point of uploading stuff

17
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.820
and then increasing the danger of being caught

18
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.300
cause if you have access to the database,

19
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.020
as we've seen here, you pretty much have

20
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.200
everything you need, you have usernames, passwords,

21
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.630
you can log in with normal username

22
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.750
and a password as a normal user,

23
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.280
or you can, if you are looking for a sensitive data,

24
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.850
we can see that we had access to credit cards.

25
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.730
You pretty much can do anything you want

26
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.370
so there is really no point of trying

27
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.770
to further exploit the system.

28
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.570
If you found an SQL Injection bingo,

29
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.970
like that's all you need really.

30
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.830
In many scenarios, we actually use a PHP shell

31
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.130
to gain access to the database and see if we can read it.

32
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.570
Like, say, for example, if you manage

33
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.880
to upload a PHP shell on the server,

34
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.730
on this server, the metasploitable,

35
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.809
but then you couldn't access the database.

36
00:01:27.809 --> 00:01:29.520
There isn't much that you can see.

37
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.700
You can't see credit cards,

38
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.030
you can't see username and passwords, you really can't.

39
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.290
Yeah you have control over the server,

40
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.000
but you can't read stuff.

41
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.310
So sometimes when you upload a PHP shell,

42
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.293
the next step is, I need to gain access to the database.

43
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.350
Another thing is that they can be used to do many things.

44
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.570
So if you find if you manage to find an SQL injection

45
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.980
in a website that is not your target,

46
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.650
so it's not the one that you're targeting,

47
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.380
but it's in the same server,

48
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.670
then you can use it to read files outside the WW route.

49
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.690
So similar to file inclusion vulnerabilities,

50
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.380
you can use it, you can use the admin the username

51
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.360
and password for the admin and see if you can upload stuff.

52
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.980
Usually the admin can upload a lot of things

53
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.290
instead of just images,

54
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.210
and then you can upload a PHP shell

55
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.470
or a backdoor from there.

56
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.833
And then from there, navigate to your target computer,

57
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.900
or to the target website, sorry.

58
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.850
Or, you can actually in some cases,

59
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.480
you can use it to upload a PHP shell,

60
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.880
you can use this an SQL injection to upload a PHP shell.

61
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.090
So basically, SQL injections can be used

62
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.000
as file inclusion vulnerabilities.

63
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.990
They can be used as file upload vulnerabilities.

64
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.570
And also they'll give you access to the whole database.

65
00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.920
That's why they are very, very dangerous

66
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.323
and very useful if you manage to find one.
