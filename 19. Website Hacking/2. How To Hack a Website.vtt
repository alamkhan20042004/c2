<v ->How would you attack a website?</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.790
You can use the methods that we've learned so far

3
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.730
into attacking a website because we said

4
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.140
a website is installed on a computer

5
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.460
so you can try to attack it and try to hack it

6
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.010
just like another computer, so you can try

7
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.843
to use the server side attacks,

8
00:00:16.843 --> 00:00:18.900
to use the server side attacks,

9
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.170
try to see the web server installed the operating system

10
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.950
all the other applications and see if you can use

11
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.980
if any of them has any vulnerabilities,

12
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.500
and if you can use any of them

13
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.000
to gain access to the computer.

14
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.980
Another way to that is to use

15
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.580
the server side attacks and the client side attacks

16
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.130
because websites are managed by humans

17
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.953
so there must be humans managing these websites and

18
00:00:42.388 --> 00:00:45.470
mandmaintaining them, so if you managed to hack any of

19
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.070
the administrators of this website,

20
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.870
then you probably be able to get

21
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.410
their username and a password

22
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.650
and then from there, log in to their admin panel

23
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.750
or to SSH, to any services

24
00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.240
that they use to manage their website.

25
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.030
If both of these ways fail, then what you can do is

26
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.560
you can try to test the web application 'cause

27
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.510
as I said, the web application is just an application

28
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.430
installed on that website.

29
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.140
So your target might actually not be the web application

30
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.077
maybe your target was just a person using that website,

31
00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:19.850
but you will never be able to get,

32
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.210
gain access to that person's computer.

33
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.800
So what you do is, you go to his website

34
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.050
hack into his website,

35
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.160
and from there go to your person.

36
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.240
So, all of these things that we're talking about

37
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.600
they're all interconnected then you can use one of them

38
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.570
to privilege and then

39
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.913
make your way to another place or to another computer.

40
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:42.770
So, in this section

41
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.520
we're not gonna be talking about the server

42
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.600
and the client side attacks

43
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.220
because you've already learned that.

44
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.800
What we're gonna be talking about is the

45
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.923
testing the security of the website application itself.

46
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.930
So my target is gonna be this Metasploitable machine.

47
00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.920
And if we do one ifconfig on it

48
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.810
you'll see it's IP is 10.20.14.204

49
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.750
and all the websites files are stored

50
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.210
in a directory called: var/www

51
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.500
and you can see that we have my our php.info

52
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.948
and we have mutillidae, dvwa and phpMyAdmin

53
00:02:14.948 --> 00:02:19.480
and we have mutillidae, dvwa and phpMyAdmin

54
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.370
so if we go to the Kali machine or to any machine

55
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.990
and try to go

56
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.140
any machine on the same network, obviously,

57
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.550
and try to go to,

58
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:31.700
let's open the browser,

59
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.150
and if we go to

60
00:02:36.112 --> 00:02:37.113
10.20.14.204

61
00:02:37.113 --> 00:02:37.946
10.20.14.204

62
00:02:37.946 --> 00:02:38.779
10.20.14.204

63
00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:40.300
10.20.14.204

64
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.450
you'll see we have a website here

65
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.090
made for Metasploitable.

66
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.040
So as you can see, a website is just

67
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.650
an application installed on the web browser.

68
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.780
And, you can see that you can access

69
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.860
any of these websites right here

70
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.083
and use it and test it's security.

71
00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.802
Another thing is the DVWA uses a username and a password

72
00:03:00.802 --> 00:03:01.635
to log in, and the username is: admin

73
00:03:01.635 --> 00:03:04.920
to log in, and the username is: admin

74
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.540
and the password is: password

75
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.110
and once you put that, then you can log in.

76
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.660
You can also modify the security settings

77
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.300
so if you go on the DVWA Security

78
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.060
I'm gonna be setting it to low,

79
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.310
and I'm always gonna be using as low

80
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.200
in the upcoming sections because we're only

81
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.560
this is just an introductory course, so

82
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.250
we're only gonna be talking about

83
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.083
the basic ways of discovering

84
00:03:29.083 --> 00:03:31.250
the basic ways of discovering

85
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.040
a web application vulnerabilities.

86
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.390
And the same with the mutillidae web application.

87
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:39.893
So if we go to it here,

88
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.713
make sure that your security is set to low,

89
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.703
so my security is set to zero right here.
