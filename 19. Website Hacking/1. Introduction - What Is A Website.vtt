00:00.630 --> 00:02.490
Instructor: Just like all of my other courses,

00:02.490 --> 00:04.530
this course is highly practical

00:04.530 --> 00:06.750
but it does not neglect the theory.

00:06.750 --> 00:08.190
So we'll start with the basics

00:08.190 --> 00:10.590
just to make sure that you really understand

00:10.590 --> 00:13.290
what web applications are and how they work,

00:13.290 --> 00:14.700
the technologies used

00:14.700 --> 00:17.280
and how these technologies work together

00:17.280 --> 00:20.943
to produce these platforms that we love and use every day.

00:22.320 --> 00:25.710
So a website is basically just a web application

00:25.710 --> 00:27.660
installed on a server,

00:27.660 --> 00:30.240
and a server is simply just a computer.

00:30.240 --> 00:31.920
So right now we have this computer.

00:31.920 --> 00:34.860
It could be any computer, it could be a personal computer

00:34.860 --> 00:36.990
and when we say it's a server,

00:36.990 --> 00:39.810
it just has certain applications on it

00:39.810 --> 00:42.300
that allow it to act as a server.

00:42.300 --> 00:45.840
Now, generally, servers on the internet are accessible

00:45.840 --> 00:47.940
from any computer on the internet.

00:47.940 --> 00:51.060
So they're hosted on the cloud as they call them now

00:51.060 --> 00:53.160
and basically it has a real IP

00:53.160 --> 00:55.530
and then anybody connected to the internet

00:55.530 --> 00:58.320
is able to communicate with this computer.

00:58.320 --> 01:00.930
Because this computer has a specific application

01:00.930 --> 01:04.410
that allow it to act as a server, we call it a server.

01:04.410 --> 01:06.360
But if you strip everything down,

01:06.360 --> 01:08.100
it basically just a computer

01:08.100 --> 01:10.110
with special programs installed on it.

01:10.110 --> 01:12.900
Then we make that computer accessible over the cloud,

01:12.900 --> 01:16.590
over the internet, which makes it very appropriate to use

01:16.590 --> 01:19.140
as a web server or a server that can be accessed

01:19.140 --> 01:21.543
from other computers or other locations.

01:22.440 --> 01:24.300
Now, a very common application

01:24.300 --> 01:28.350
that could make it act as a server is a web server.

01:28.350 --> 01:29.790
Now, what is a web server?

01:29.790 --> 01:32.070
It's basically an application that you can install

01:32.070 --> 01:33.030
on any computer

01:33.030 --> 01:35.610
so the computer doesn't even have to be exposed

01:35.610 --> 01:36.443
to the internet.

01:36.443 --> 01:38.940
You can install it on your own local computer,

01:38.940 --> 01:41.040
even if it's not connected to the internet.

01:41.040 --> 01:42.720
It's just an application.

01:42.720 --> 01:44.580
And what that application does,

01:44.580 --> 01:48.690
it specifies a certain location within your file system

01:48.690 --> 01:51.420
and in that location you can host files.

01:51.420 --> 01:54.270
So anybody connected to the same network as you,

01:54.270 --> 01:57.210
or if this computer is exposed to the internet

01:57.210 --> 02:00.690
and anybody that is on the internet will be able to access

02:00.690 --> 02:04.020
the files stored within the web route

02:04.020 --> 02:06.720
or the file that the web server uses to serve files

02:06.720 --> 02:08.220
to the users.

02:08.220 --> 02:10.890
Now, web servers usually also contain

02:10.890 --> 02:12.720
the web application files.

02:12.720 --> 02:16.110
So a web application is similar to any application.

02:16.110 --> 02:19.740
The only difference is it's designed to run on a web server

02:19.740 --> 02:22.920
and designed to be served over the internet

02:22.920 --> 02:24.840
to another computer.

02:24.840 --> 02:28.740
So the web server can execute web application languages

02:28.740 --> 02:31.080
similar to PHP, Python and Ruby.

02:31.080 --> 02:34.230
So you would have the web application files stored

02:34.230 --> 02:36.420
within the web server 'cause like I said,

02:36.420 --> 02:38.250
the initial goal of the web server

02:38.250 --> 02:41.700
is to be able to serve files to remote computers

02:41.700 --> 02:44.673
using a web browser, using the HTTP protocol.

02:45.510 --> 02:48.000
The web application files contain codes

02:48.000 --> 02:50.280
so the website files could be images,

02:50.280 --> 02:51.980
they could be normal HTML files,

02:51.980 --> 02:53.820
so they don't really contain code.

02:53.820 --> 02:55.710
But the web application files,

02:55.710 --> 02:59.130
they actually contain code written in a program and language

02:59.130 --> 03:02.610
that can process information and manipulate it

03:02.610 --> 03:04.470
and do useful tasks.

03:04.470 --> 03:06.300
So it would be written in languages

03:06.300 --> 03:08.850
like PHP, Python, Ruby, and so on.

03:08.850 --> 03:11.820
And most websites that actually do something useful

03:11.820 --> 03:14.700
other than websites just simply display information

03:14.700 --> 03:17.160
like a shop website, they would actually be written

03:17.160 --> 03:19.563
in a programming language such as these.

03:20.880 --> 03:22.800
Now, another very common component

03:22.800 --> 03:26.010
of a website is the database.

03:26.010 --> 03:30.150
So the web server contains the files like images,

03:30.150 --> 03:31.950
styling files, HTML files.

03:31.950 --> 03:34.620
These are all just used to display the website

03:34.620 --> 03:35.730
to render the website

03:35.730 --> 03:37.560
and then you have the web application files

03:37.560 --> 03:41.460
which is the ones run on the server side to process data.

03:41.460 --> 03:45.270
But the data is usually stored in a different application

03:45.270 --> 03:46.950
which is called a database.

03:46.950 --> 03:49.560
Now the database contains a number of tables

03:49.560 --> 03:52.410
and we have in here a sample of a table.

03:52.410 --> 03:55.170
And we're assuming that this table contains products

03:55.170 --> 03:57.780
that are being sold on a shop website.

03:57.780 --> 04:01.170
So you can see we have the ID of the products.

04:01.170 --> 04:03.180
We have the title so this is an iPhone,

04:03.180 --> 04:05.340
an iPad, a mouse, and the price,

04:05.340 --> 04:08.193
we have the price in here for each of these products.

04:09.090 --> 04:12.300
So the web server contains the HTML pages,

04:12.300 --> 04:14.730
the beautiful pages that you actually see.

04:14.730 --> 04:15.840
The ones with the...

04:15.840 --> 04:18.540
It contains the images so the images for the iPhones,

04:18.540 --> 04:21.540
the iPads, the mouses that this website is selling.

04:21.540 --> 04:25.980
It also contains a web application that interacts

04:25.980 --> 04:29.970
with the database to display all of these products.

04:29.970 --> 04:32.850
So the web application itself doesn't contain the products.

04:32.850 --> 04:36.480
The product information is stored in the database.

04:36.480 --> 04:39.090
Now, the database contains a number of tables.

04:39.090 --> 04:41.820
This is just one example of a table.

04:41.820 --> 04:44.190
It'll contain tables, for example, for the users

04:44.190 --> 04:46.380
and it'll contain the usernames and the passwords.

04:46.380 --> 04:48.300
And then users, when they log in,

04:48.300 --> 04:51.510
the web application will communicate with the database

04:51.510 --> 04:53.580
to check if the username you supplied

04:53.580 --> 04:55.620
is the same one as the password.

04:55.620 --> 04:57.360
So it's very important to understand

04:57.360 --> 04:59.010
the role of the database.

04:59.010 --> 05:01.260
Web application stored on the web server,

05:01.260 --> 05:04.950
it just communicates with the database, gets information

05:04.950 --> 05:08.220
and then displays it or does something useful with it

05:08.220 --> 05:11.310
but the data itself is not stored on the web server,

05:11.310 --> 05:13.530
it's not stored within the web application.

05:13.530 --> 05:15.813
It's actually stored on the database.
