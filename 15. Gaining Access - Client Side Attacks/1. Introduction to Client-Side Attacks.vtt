00:00.000 --> 00:00.960
-: In this section,

00:00.960 --> 00:04.200
we're gonna start talking about client side attacks.

00:04.200 --> 00:07.560
So most of the time it's better to try to gain access

00:07.560 --> 00:10.230
to your target using the server side attacks.

00:10.230 --> 00:13.530
So try to find exploits in the operating system

00:13.530 --> 00:16.020
and in the applications installed.

00:16.020 --> 00:18.270
If you tried that and it didn't work,

00:18.270 --> 00:20.970
or if your target is hidden behind an IP,

00:20.970 --> 00:23.760
so if the target person is not in the same server as us,

00:23.760 --> 00:25.320
on the same network as us,

00:25.320 --> 00:28.290
and if the target person is using a network,

00:28.290 --> 00:31.320
so if you ping their IP you won't be able to reach it

00:31.320 --> 00:33.300
because they're hidden behind the router

00:33.300 --> 00:35.190
or behind a network,

00:35.190 --> 00:36.990
then your next resort

00:36.990 --> 00:39.600
is going to be the client side attacks.

00:39.600 --> 00:42.300
So these attacks require the user to do something.

00:42.300 --> 00:44.280
So the user is gonna have to open a link,

00:44.280 --> 00:45.900
they're gonna have to install an update,

00:45.900 --> 00:48.420
they're gonna have to install a picture or open a picture,

00:48.420 --> 00:50.520
or they have to interact, they have to do something.

00:50.520 --> 00:51.570
And once they do it,

00:51.570 --> 00:54.603
we will be able to run code and achieve our goal.

00:55.650 --> 00:58.290
Therefore, because it requires user interaction,

00:58.290 --> 01:01.410
information gathering is very important in this case,

01:01.410 --> 01:04.110
and we don't only need to get information

01:04.110 --> 01:06.000
about the installed applications.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.980
We also need to know the person.

01:07.980 --> 01:09.810
We need to know their friends.

01:09.810 --> 01:11.760
We need to know the networks they use,

01:11.760 --> 01:13.200
the websites they use,

01:13.200 --> 01:18.090
if there's any websites that they frequently use and trust.

01:18.090 --> 01:21.750
Therefore, the information gathering section in here

01:21.750 --> 01:24.030
is going to be focused on the person

01:24.030 --> 01:26.970
rather than focused on the applications

01:26.970 --> 01:28.653
and on the operating system.
