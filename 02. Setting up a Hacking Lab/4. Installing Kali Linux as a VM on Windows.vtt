00:00.000 --> 00:01.440
Instructor: In this lecture,

00:01.440 --> 00:03.300
I'm gonna show you how to install

00:03.300 --> 00:08.300
Kali Linux as a Virtual Machine inside Windows.

00:08.790 --> 00:10.710
Skip this lecture if you're running

00:10.710 --> 00:12.810
Apple, macOS, or Linux,

00:12.810 --> 00:15.303
as I will cover that in the next lectures.

00:16.200 --> 00:19.080
Now, I already have it downloaded in here.

00:19.080 --> 00:21.360
This is an archive that contains

00:21.360 --> 00:24.030
the actual Virtual Image of Kali.

00:24.030 --> 00:26.070
We did that to compress its size,

00:26.070 --> 00:28.950
so that it doesn't take a long time to download.

00:28.950 --> 00:30.840
So now that we have it downloaded,

00:30.840 --> 00:33.030
we're gonna need to install a program

00:33.030 --> 00:36.360
that can uncompress 7-ZIP Archives

00:36.360 --> 00:38.520
and show us the contents.

00:38.520 --> 00:40.590
To do that, we're gonna go to Chrome,

00:40.590 --> 00:43.080
and you wanna go to 7-zip.org.

00:43.080 --> 00:46.140
I will include that in the resources of this lecture.

00:46.140 --> 00:48.090
And you wanna download the version

00:48.090 --> 00:50.700
that is compatible with your operating system.

00:50.700 --> 00:53.070
I have a 64 bit operating system,

00:53.070 --> 00:55.143
so I'm downloading the 64 bit.

00:56.100 --> 00:57.630
And once the download is complete,

00:57.630 --> 01:00.600
we can simply click on it to install it,

01:00.600 --> 01:02.790
give it Permissions,

01:02.790 --> 01:04.860
and click on Install.

01:04.860 --> 01:06.420
Once the install is complete,

01:06.420 --> 01:08.280
we're gonna click on Close,

01:08.280 --> 01:11.820
and we're gonna go back on our Downloads Directory.

01:11.820 --> 01:15.390
And right now, because we installed 7-ZIP, this program,

01:15.390 --> 01:18.420
we're gonna be able to uncompress this archive

01:18.420 --> 01:21.510
and see the Virtual Image inside it.

01:21.510 --> 01:23.370
So I'm gonna right click,

01:23.370 --> 01:26.670
and as you can see, I have an entry called 7-Zip now.

01:26.670 --> 01:28.290
And if I hover over it

01:28.290 --> 01:32.730
and click on Extract Here, it will uncompress that image

01:32.730 --> 01:34.830
and reveal its contents.

01:34.830 --> 01:37.980
As you can see now, we have a new directory

01:37.980 --> 01:42.150
and you can see the extension now is .vmwarevm.

01:42.150 --> 01:43.980
So as mentioned in the previous lecture,

01:43.980 --> 01:46.500
VMware is the software that we're gonna use

01:46.500 --> 01:50.280
to run different operating systems as Virtual Machines.

01:50.280 --> 01:55.280
And this file right here is designed to run inside VMware

01:55.350 --> 01:56.820
as a Virtual Machine.

01:56.820 --> 01:59.700
So in order to run it, we're gonna have to go ahead

01:59.700 --> 02:01.950
and install VMware.

02:01.950 --> 02:04.470
Now, you can download VMware from the same page

02:04.470 --> 02:06.720
where you downloaded the Custom Kali.

02:06.720 --> 02:08.760
I'm gonna include its link in the resources

02:08.760 --> 02:10.320
of this lecture as well.

02:10.320 --> 02:12.360
I already have it opened in here.

02:12.360 --> 02:13.920
And we're just gonna scroll down

02:13.920 --> 02:16.020
past the Kali download links.

02:16.020 --> 02:17.760
You'll see we have a new section here

02:17.760 --> 02:20.100
that has the VMware player download links

02:20.100 --> 02:22.200
for all operating systems.

02:22.200 --> 02:23.700
Make sure you download the correct one

02:23.700 --> 02:25.200
for your operating system.

02:25.200 --> 02:28.260
We're covering installing Kali on Windows in this lecturer,

02:28.260 --> 02:30.510
that's why we're gonna download the Windows one.

02:30.510 --> 02:33.030
And installing Kali for other operating systems

02:33.030 --> 02:35.730
is covered in the next lectures as mentioned.

02:35.730 --> 02:38.733
So we're gonna click on this link in here to download it,

02:39.960 --> 02:43.620
and we're gonna click on Download in here again.

02:43.620 --> 02:46.170
And that's gonna start the download process for us.

02:48.240 --> 02:49.377
Once the download is complete,

02:49.377 --> 02:51.990
you can simply view it in your Downloads

02:51.990 --> 02:54.360
or click it here to run it.

02:54.360 --> 02:55.743
Give its Permissions.

02:56.670 --> 02:59.490
And similar to installing any software on Windows,

02:59.490 --> 03:01.260
you really don't need to do much.

03:01.260 --> 03:04.980
We're simply just gonna click on Next, Next, Next, Next.

03:04.980 --> 03:06.510
Accept the Agreement.

03:06.510 --> 03:07.980
Next, Next, Next.

03:07.980 --> 03:09.570
And let it install.

03:09.570 --> 03:11.010
The installation is complete.

03:11.010 --> 03:13.290
We're gonna click on Finish.

03:13.290 --> 03:15.720
And now we should be able

03:15.720 --> 03:18.390
to run this Virtual Machine file

03:18.390 --> 03:22.260
that we downloaded the .vmwarevm file,

03:22.260 --> 03:26.100
using VMware Workstation Player.

03:26.100 --> 03:28.800
So we're gonna double click it to start it.

03:28.800 --> 03:30.393
And I'm gonna minimize this.

03:31.560 --> 03:34.350
We're gonna click on Open Virtual Machine in here,

03:34.350 --> 03:39.000
or you can go on the Player, File and Open.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.800
We're gonna navigate to the location

03:40.800 --> 03:44.040
where we downloaded the Virtual Image of Kali

03:44.040 --> 03:45.630
in my Downloads.

03:45.630 --> 03:48.090
And as you can see, we have it in here.

03:48.090 --> 03:51.540
Keep in mind, it's the .vmwarevm file,

03:51.540 --> 03:54.900
so it ends with .vmwarevm.

03:54.900 --> 03:58.110
We're gonna click on it, we're gonna click on Open.

03:58.110 --> 04:00.750
And inside it, we have another file,

04:00.750 --> 04:03.030
the only one file that we can select,

04:03.030 --> 04:06.060
we're gonna select it and click on Open.

04:06.060 --> 04:08.160
If you get no errors, as you can see in here,

04:08.160 --> 04:09.780
in my case, that's it.

04:09.780 --> 04:13.500
The machine is now installed and ready to be used.

04:13.500 --> 04:14.970
Now, before running it,

04:14.970 --> 04:17.880
I'm gonna click on Edit Virtual Machine Settings

04:17.880 --> 04:20.160
or right click and Settings,

04:20.160 --> 04:23.640
just to give you an idea of what the settings look like,

04:23.640 --> 04:26.310
so you feel more comfortable with VMware,

04:26.310 --> 04:29.190
because modifying Virtual Machine Settings

04:29.190 --> 04:32.460
is always the same regardless of what type

04:32.460 --> 04:34.710
of Virtual Machine it is.

04:34.710 --> 04:37.950
So as you can see in this window, first of all,

04:37.950 --> 04:40.050
we can modify the amount of memory

04:40.050 --> 04:41.790
that the Virtual Machine has,

04:41.790 --> 04:44.340
and this machine is set to two gigabytes

04:44.340 --> 04:45.870
of memory by default.

04:45.870 --> 04:48.360
That is enough, but you can increase it up

04:48.360 --> 04:50.283
or down using this slider.

04:51.270 --> 04:53.850
You can also modify the amount of Processors

04:53.850 --> 04:55.530
that the machine has.

04:55.530 --> 04:56.550
So as you can see,

04:56.550 --> 04:59.190
this one has two Processors assigned to it.

04:59.190 --> 05:00.060
That is plenty.

05:00.060 --> 05:01.560
It's enough, as you'll see,

05:01.560 --> 05:04.530
but you can give it more if you want to give it more.

05:04.530 --> 05:08.640
Another really important option is the Network Adapter.

05:08.640 --> 05:11.520
And as you can see, this is set to NAT,

05:11.520 --> 05:15.180
and this setting will basically create a Virtual Network,

05:15.180 --> 05:17.400
where my Host Machine is going

05:17.400 --> 05:19.950
to be the Router for this Network.

05:19.950 --> 05:22.170
And then all the Virtual Machines

05:22.170 --> 05:25.890
are going to be Clients connected to this Network.

05:25.890 --> 05:28.170
So they're going to get internet connection

05:28.170 --> 05:30.450
from my Host Machine.

05:30.450 --> 05:32.070
And at the same time,

05:32.070 --> 05:35.070
all of my Virtual Machines will be connected

05:35.070 --> 05:38.400
to the same Virtual Network.

05:38.400 --> 05:39.540
This is very handy,

05:39.540 --> 05:42.870
because my Virtual Machines will be able to communicate

05:42.870 --> 05:44.850
with each other and therefore,

05:44.850 --> 05:47.190
will be able to use the Kali Machine to hack

05:47.190 --> 05:50.610
into the others, will be able to test network attacks,

05:50.610 --> 05:52.560
and do much more.

05:52.560 --> 05:55.080
So this setting will first allow my Virtual Machines

05:55.080 --> 05:56.670
to have internet connection

05:56.670 --> 05:59.940
and it will also allow them to communicate with each other

05:59.940 --> 06:03.120
through this Virtual NAT Network.

06:03.120 --> 06:07.110
Now, this Virtual Network will rely on the connection

06:07.110 --> 06:08.730
of your host computer.

06:08.730 --> 06:11.430
So it will not need any extra interfaces,

06:11.430 --> 06:13.920
it will not need any extra adapters.

06:13.920 --> 06:17.010
And as far as the Virtual Machines are concerned,

06:17.010 --> 06:20.190
they are connected to an Ethernet Network,

06:20.190 --> 06:24.303
but in reality, they are connected through the Host Machine.

06:25.230 --> 06:27.780
You can also modify the Display Settings in here,

06:27.780 --> 06:30.660
if you have a bigger screen or a smaller screen.

06:30.660 --> 06:33.690
And I usually like to tick this box in here,

06:33.690 --> 06:36.690
the Accelerate 3D Graphics.

06:36.690 --> 06:38.850
And that's pretty much it.

06:38.850 --> 06:40.710
So we're gonna click on OK.

06:40.710 --> 06:42.600
And like I said, you actually don't need

06:42.600 --> 06:45.000
to modify any of these settings.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.120
I just wanted to show you what kind of settings we can set

06:48.120 --> 06:49.830
for these Virtual Machines.

06:49.830 --> 06:52.230
But once you're ready to run the Virtual Machine,

06:52.230 --> 06:55.650
we're just gonna click on the green Play button to start it.

06:55.650 --> 06:57.000
Now, I'm gonna click on inside

06:57.000 --> 06:59.580
and click Enter to start Kali.

06:59.580 --> 07:01.260
And I know it's starting very small,

07:01.260 --> 07:03.990
this is because I have a High Resolution Screen.

07:03.990 --> 07:07.080
It's probably gonna start in the normal size for you.

07:07.080 --> 07:09.210
I'm just gonna zoom in for you.

07:09.210 --> 07:12.270
And perfect, we have the login screen here for Kali,

07:12.270 --> 07:15.870
so the username is ROOT,

07:15.870 --> 07:20.010
and the password is TOOR, the reverse.

07:20.010 --> 07:22.050
We're gonna hit Enter.

07:22.050 --> 07:24.000
And perfect, as you can see now,

07:24.000 --> 07:27.300
we are running this Linux Operating System

07:27.300 --> 07:32.040
as a Virtual Machine inside my Windows Operating System

07:32.040 --> 07:33.210
in here.

07:33.210 --> 07:35.550
And we're gonna use this Linux Operating System

07:35.550 --> 07:38.940
for hacking as we go through the course.

07:38.940 --> 07:42.420
Now, before we wrap it up, I wanna go into Full Screen.

07:42.420 --> 07:44.520
So we're gonna click on the Player,

07:44.520 --> 07:47.130
and we're gonna click on Full Screen.

07:47.130 --> 07:49.020
And as you can see, this will automatically

07:49.020 --> 07:50.400
go in Full Screen.

07:50.400 --> 07:53.160
So again, I'm still using Kali within

07:53.160 --> 07:56.490
my Host Operating System, which is Windows.

07:56.490 --> 07:59.250
And in most cases, Kali will look normal.

07:59.250 --> 08:02.490
But as you can see, in my case, the icons are very small

08:02.490 --> 08:05.340
and the text here on the top is very small,

08:05.340 --> 08:08.970
and that's because I have a 4K Display.

08:08.970 --> 08:12.510
So we're gonna need to manually modify the Display Settings.

08:12.510 --> 08:16.293
And to do that, we're gonna right click, go to Settings,

08:18.330 --> 08:21.663
and we're gonna set the Scale to 200.

08:22.740 --> 08:24.453
I'm gonna click on Apply.

08:25.860 --> 08:27.690
We're gonna keep the changes.

08:27.690 --> 08:30.570
And perfect, now Kali looks normal for me.

08:30.570 --> 08:32.790
You don't have to do this if Kali looked normal

08:32.790 --> 08:36.030
from the start, only if you have a High Resolution Screen,

08:36.030 --> 08:38.100
you might have to do this.

08:38.100 --> 08:39.840
Now, I know this operating system

08:39.840 --> 08:43.110
looks a little bit confusing and scary,

08:43.110 --> 08:45.090
but don't worry about it at all,

08:45.090 --> 08:47.880
I will teach you how to use it step-by-step

08:47.880 --> 08:50.160
as we go through the course.

08:50.160 --> 08:53.160
If you face any issues while installing Kali,

08:53.160 --> 08:55.200
check out the Featured Questions first,

08:55.200 --> 08:56.790
and if you don't see your answer,

08:56.790 --> 09:00.090
feel free to ask us in the Q&amp;A or in the Forums,

09:00.090 --> 09:04.920
and we will respond to you within a maximum of 15 hours.

09:04.920 --> 09:08.610
And to turn off Kali, you can simply click here,

09:08.610 --> 09:11.373
go to Power Off, and Power Off,

09:12.330 --> 09:14.580
click on Power Off one more time,

09:14.580 --> 09:16.383
and the machine will shut down.
