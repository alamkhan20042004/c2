00:00.660 --> 00:02.250
Instructor: In this lecture, I'm gonna show you

00:02.250 --> 00:04.350
how to install Kali Linux

00:04.350 --> 00:07.863
as a virtual machine on Apple macOS.

00:10.020 --> 00:12.720
Skip this lecture if you already have Kali

00:12.720 --> 00:14.370
and VMware installed,

00:14.370 --> 00:17.070
or if you want to install it on Linux.

00:17.070 --> 00:20.790
I will cover installing it on Linux in the next lecture.

00:20.790 --> 00:22.950
The installation steps that I'm gonna show you

00:22.950 --> 00:25.290
will work on all Apple computers,

00:25.290 --> 00:28.620
whether they use the older 64-bit processors

00:28.620 --> 00:32.490
or the new silicon chips, the M1, M2, M3, and so on.

00:32.490 --> 00:34.710
Just make sure you download the correct version

00:34.710 --> 00:36.030
from the download page.

00:36.030 --> 00:38.940
If you have an older 64-bit Apple computer,

00:38.940 --> 00:41.490
then download the 64-bit version.

00:41.490 --> 00:44.790
If you have one of the newer Apple silicon computers,

00:44.790 --> 00:46.560
then make sure you download the version

00:46.560 --> 00:49.950
that is made for the Apple silicon computers.

00:49.950 --> 00:51.900
I already have the correct version

00:51.900 --> 00:55.200
downloaded for my computer in my downloads in here,

00:55.200 --> 00:57.360
but as you can see, it is compressed

00:57.360 --> 00:59.370
inside a 7-Zip archive.

00:59.370 --> 01:01.770
We did this to reduce the size of the image

01:01.770 --> 01:03.540
so you can download it faster.

01:03.540 --> 01:07.050
So in order to use it, we have to decompress it first,

01:07.050 --> 01:10.770
and to do that, you can simply double click the archive.

01:10.770 --> 01:14.160
As you can see now, the archive is getting decompressed.

01:14.160 --> 01:17.310
You wanna give it some time. This might take a minute or so.

01:17.310 --> 01:20.520
Once done, you're gonna get a new file as you can see,

01:20.520 --> 01:24.990
and this new file has a .vmwarevm extension.

01:24.990 --> 01:27.780
So this is the actual virtual image file

01:27.780 --> 01:32.010
that will allow us to run Kali Linux as a virtual machine.

01:32.010 --> 01:35.040
To do this, to run Kali Linux as a virtual machine

01:35.040 --> 01:37.620
inside our current operating system,

01:37.620 --> 01:40.830
we're gonna have to install a virtualization software.

01:40.830 --> 01:44.340
And the one that we're going to use is called VMware.

01:44.340 --> 01:46.680
You can download VMware from the same page

01:46.680 --> 01:49.440
where you downloaded the custom Kali Linux.

01:49.440 --> 01:50.630
I'm gonna include its link

01:50.630 --> 01:53.730
in the resources of this lecture as well.

01:53.730 --> 01:56.520
And we're simply gonna scroll down

01:56.520 --> 01:58.650
past the Kali download links.

01:58.650 --> 02:02.250
You'll see a section here that allows you to download VMware

02:02.250 --> 02:04.290
for all operating systems.

02:04.290 --> 02:07.170
Now since we're installing Kali on an Apple computer,

02:07.170 --> 02:08.940
make sure you download the version

02:08.940 --> 02:10.920
that is made for Apple computers.

02:10.920 --> 02:12.570
So we're gonna click on this link

02:13.500 --> 02:15.900
and we're gonna click on Download one more time.

02:17.550 --> 02:19.710
If you get a message like this one

02:19.710 --> 02:22.140
saying unverified download blocked,

02:22.140 --> 02:24.360
click Download file anyway.

02:24.360 --> 02:25.380
You're only getting this

02:25.380 --> 02:27.690
because you're downloading the file from here,

02:27.690 --> 02:30.540
but you can validate the integrity of the file

02:30.540 --> 02:32.790
using the signature in here.

02:32.790 --> 02:34.110
Once the download is complete,

02:34.110 --> 02:36.240
you're gonna see VMware downloaded

02:36.240 --> 02:38.640
in your downloads directory in Finder.

02:38.640 --> 02:41.340
And to install it, we're simply gonna double click it.

02:42.300 --> 02:44.130
And installing it is identical

02:44.130 --> 02:47.400
to installing any program on Apple macOS.

02:47.400 --> 02:51.333
So we're simply gonna double click it, click Open,

02:53.280 --> 02:58.280
enter the password, agree to the terms.

02:58.410 --> 03:01.440
This program is free to use for personal use,

03:01.440 --> 03:02.700
which is what we're doing here.

03:02.700 --> 03:05.130
So you can simply use the product key

03:05.130 --> 03:07.350
that I'm using myself here in this video.

03:07.350 --> 03:10.380
I'm also gonna include it in the resources of this lecture.

03:10.380 --> 03:13.293
And we're gonna click on Continue and Done.

03:14.340 --> 03:16.620
Now you might be asked for permissions

03:16.620 --> 03:19.080
to offer extra features, so we're gonna allow it.

03:19.080 --> 03:19.950
You can allow this

03:19.950 --> 03:22.323
by clicking on the system preferences here.

03:23.490 --> 03:26.730
Click on the lock icon to edit the preferences,

03:26.730 --> 03:31.730
put the password, and tick the box next to VMware.

03:31.800 --> 03:34.320
Once done, we're gonna close the preferences,

03:34.320 --> 03:35.490
and as you can see,

03:35.490 --> 03:38.430
we have VMware's welcome screen right here,

03:38.430 --> 03:39.960
which will allow you to create

03:39.960 --> 03:42.360
or import a new virtual machine.

03:42.360 --> 03:44.790
I'm actually gonna close this because I want to show you

03:44.790 --> 03:46.800
how to launch the program from scratch,

03:46.800 --> 03:50.280
and then how to import and add virtual machines to it.

03:50.280 --> 03:53.820
So to do that simply we're gonna go to all applications,

03:53.820 --> 03:57.360
and you can look for VMware in the search bar

03:57.360 --> 04:00.333
or simply just scroll through until you find it.

04:02.160 --> 04:03.900
One click will start the program

04:03.900 --> 04:06.450
and you'll see that we're back to the same welcome screen

04:06.450 --> 04:10.050
that allows us to create or import new virtual machines.

04:10.050 --> 04:12.930
But we actually want to use a ready virtual machine

04:12.930 --> 04:15.270
that I've already created for you.

04:15.270 --> 04:18.150
So all you have to do is simply go back to the downloads

04:18.150 --> 04:21.360
where you downloaded the custom Kali in Finder.

04:21.360 --> 04:23.190
And this is the image that I downloaded

04:23.190 --> 04:26.040
and showed you at the start of the lecture.

04:26.040 --> 04:27.900
The whole process that I showed you so far

04:27.900 --> 04:30.120
should work on all Apple computers.

04:30.120 --> 04:31.260
You just want to make sure

04:31.260 --> 04:34.170
that you download the correct version for your computer.

04:34.170 --> 04:36.690
If you have a silicon-based ARM processor,

04:36.690 --> 04:39.030
then make sure you download the ARM version.

04:39.030 --> 04:41.550
If you have an older 64-bit processor,

04:41.550 --> 04:44.730
then make sure you download the 64-bit version.

04:44.730 --> 04:46.980
So I have the correct version downloaded in here,

04:46.980 --> 04:51.630
and I'm simply going to double click it to run it in VMware.

04:51.630 --> 04:54.390
Now, because this is the first time I run this machine,

04:54.390 --> 04:56.430
it's given me an option to upgrade it.

04:56.430 --> 04:59.310
You might not always get this depending on your settings,

04:59.310 --> 05:01.080
but if you get it, click on Upgrade.

05:01.080 --> 05:02.670
This will give you more features

05:02.670 --> 05:05.070
and more freedom with using the virtual machine.

05:05.070 --> 05:07.590
And we're gonna say OK for this warning message,

05:07.590 --> 05:09.570
and we're gonna say that we copied it.

05:09.570 --> 05:12.510
And perfect, now this virtual machine is actually booting

05:12.510 --> 05:15.090
inside my own operating system.

05:15.090 --> 05:17.100
So now it's asking us to log in.

05:17.100 --> 05:20.760
The default username is root, R-O-O-T,

05:20.760 --> 05:24.240
and the default password is toor, T-O-O-R.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.983
I'm gonna hit Enter to log in.

05:26.880 --> 05:28.770
And perfect, now I'm logged in

05:28.770 --> 05:32.190
and I'm running Kali Linux as a virtual machine

05:32.190 --> 05:35.070
inside my main operating system,

05:35.070 --> 05:38.460
which is this macOS computer.

05:38.460 --> 05:39.660
To go on full screen,

05:39.660 --> 05:42.540
you can simply click the green button in here

05:42.540 --> 05:45.510
and the resolution will automatically change.

05:45.510 --> 05:47.910
I know this might look a little bit scary,

05:47.910 --> 05:49.530
but don't worry about it.

05:49.530 --> 05:51.720
I will walk you through it step by step

05:51.720 --> 05:53.310
as we go through the course,

05:53.310 --> 05:56.043
and you'll see how easy it is to use it for hacking.

05:57.510 --> 05:59.310
For now, to exit the full screen,

05:59.310 --> 06:01.920
you can simply go to the top, keep the mouse there,

06:01.920 --> 06:03.723
and click the green button again.

06:04.680 --> 06:06.030
And to turn this machine off,

06:06.030 --> 06:08.790
you can simply click the turn off button in here,

06:08.790 --> 06:11.973
click the power button again, and click Power Off.

06:14.280 --> 06:17.913
Click Power Off one more time, and now the machine is off.

06:18.990 --> 06:20.640
Now in here on the top right,

06:20.640 --> 06:23.430
you can see we have a VMware icon,

06:23.430 --> 06:25.410
and if you click it, you'll see a list

06:25.410 --> 06:27.210
of all of the virtual machines

06:27.210 --> 06:29.970
installed inside your current operating system.

06:29.970 --> 06:31.860
As you can see, I only have one

06:31.860 --> 06:34.530
because we already installed one so far.

06:34.530 --> 06:36.900
If you click the virtual machine library in here,

06:36.900 --> 06:38.700
again, it'll show you a nice window

06:38.700 --> 06:41.220
with a list of all the installed virtual machines.

06:41.220 --> 06:44.310
And if you wanna edit the settings of any of these machines,

06:44.310 --> 06:47.523
you can simply right click it and click on Settings.

06:48.750 --> 06:51.270
This machine is already configured to run well,

06:51.270 --> 06:54.150
but you can modify this if you have more resources

06:54.150 --> 06:56.220
to get it to run even faster.

06:56.220 --> 06:58.560
So I just wanna show you how to modify the settings

06:58.560 --> 07:01.650
because the process is the same for any virtual machine

07:01.650 --> 07:04.170
that you might install even in the future.

07:04.170 --> 07:06.660
Usually, the main settings that affect performance

07:06.660 --> 07:09.270
are the processors and memory.

07:09.270 --> 07:11.370
So here you can adjust the amount of memory

07:11.370 --> 07:14.463
that this virtual machine can use by moving the slider,

07:15.480 --> 07:17.790
and you can change the number of processors

07:17.790 --> 07:21.390
that this machine can use using this dropdown menu.

07:21.390 --> 07:23.340
By default, this is set to two processors

07:23.340 --> 07:24.960
and two gigabytes of memory.

07:24.960 --> 07:27.420
This is enough to run the machine decently,

07:27.420 --> 07:28.920
but if you have more resources,

07:28.920 --> 07:30.570
then feel free to increase this

07:30.570 --> 07:33.510
to get the virtual machine to run even faster.

07:33.510 --> 07:34.440
Now, let's go back

07:34.440 --> 07:36.870
and I also wanna show you the network settings

07:36.870 --> 07:39.030
for this specific virtual machine.

07:39.030 --> 07:39.863
And as you can see,

07:39.863 --> 07:42.630
by default, this is set to share with my Mac,

07:42.630 --> 07:45.840
and this basically sets up a virtual network

07:45.840 --> 07:47.520
where my host machine

07:47.520 --> 07:50.610
is going to be the router for this network,

07:50.610 --> 07:52.830
and then all the virtual machines

07:52.830 --> 07:56.550
are going to be clients connected to this network.

07:56.550 --> 07:58.830
So they're going to get internet connection

07:58.830 --> 08:01.110
from my host machine.

08:01.110 --> 08:04.530
And at the same time, all of my virtual machines

08:04.530 --> 08:09.090
will be connected to the same virtual network.

08:09.090 --> 08:11.940
This is very handy because my virtual machines

08:11.940 --> 08:14.760
will be able to communicate with each other,

08:14.760 --> 08:17.460
and therefore will be able to use the Kali machine

08:17.460 --> 08:18.960
to hack into the others,

08:18.960 --> 08:23.220
will be able to test network attacks and do much more.

08:23.220 --> 08:25.740
So this setting will first allow my virtual machines

08:25.740 --> 08:27.330
to have internet connection,

08:27.330 --> 08:30.600
and it'll also allow them to communicate with each other

08:30.600 --> 08:33.780
through this virtual NAT network.

08:33.780 --> 08:37.770
Now, this virtual network will rely on the connection

08:37.770 --> 08:39.390
of your host computer.

08:39.390 --> 08:42.090
So it will not need any extra interfaces,

08:42.090 --> 08:44.580
it will not need any extra adapters.

08:44.580 --> 08:47.670
And as far as the virtual machines are concerned,

08:47.670 --> 08:50.850
they are connected to an ethernet network,

08:50.850 --> 08:54.963
but in reality, they are connected through the host machine.

08:56.250 --> 08:58.080
Again, click on Show All to go back

08:58.080 --> 09:00.240
to all of the other settings.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.820
But like I said, you don't need to modify anything.

09:02.820 --> 09:04.230
Everything should be configured

09:04.230 --> 09:08.250
and set properly for you to run with no issues at all.

09:08.250 --> 09:09.600
If you face any issues,

09:09.600 --> 09:11.190
then check out the featured questions,

09:11.190 --> 09:12.810
and feel free to ask us.

09:12.810 --> 09:16.233
We will respond to you within less than 15 hours.

09:17.190 --> 09:20.160
And like I said, don't worry about how to use Kali.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.740
I will cover that in detail step by step

09:22.740 --> 09:24.213
as we go through the course.
