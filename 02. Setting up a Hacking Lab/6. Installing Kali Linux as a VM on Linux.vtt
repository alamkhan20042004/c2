00:00.000 --> 00:00.990
Instructor: In this lecture,

00:00.990 --> 00:02.880
I'm gonna show you how to install

00:02.880 --> 00:07.083
Kali Linux as a virtual machine inside Linux.

00:08.130 --> 00:11.300
Skip this lecture if you have it already installed,

00:11.300 --> 00:13.800
and revise the previous lectures

00:13.800 --> 00:17.883
to see how to install it on Windows or Apple macOS.

00:19.080 --> 00:23.070
Now, I already have it downloaded in here in my downloads.

00:23.070 --> 00:25.680
And as you can see, this is an archive

00:25.680 --> 00:28.350
with a 7 zip extension.

00:28.350 --> 00:32.850
The actual virtual image is compressed inside this archive.

00:32.850 --> 00:34.447
We did this to reduce its size,

00:34.447 --> 00:36.600
so you can download it quicker.

00:36.600 --> 00:39.270
But in order to use this virtual image,

00:39.270 --> 00:42.240
we're gonna have to uncompress the archive.

00:42.240 --> 00:44.850
To do that, you simply have to right click it

00:44.850 --> 00:47.610
and click on extract here.

00:47.610 --> 00:49.110
You're gonna need to give it some time

00:49.110 --> 00:54.110
to fully uncompress the archive and reveal its content.

00:54.390 --> 00:58.050
Once this is done, you're gonna see a new directory in here

00:58.050 --> 01:00.840
that contains the actual image,

01:00.840 --> 01:05.163
and you'll notice that this folder ends with .vmwarevm.

01:06.120 --> 01:09.840
So in order to run this virtual image of Kali Linux,

01:09.840 --> 01:12.930
we need to install a virtualization software.

01:12.930 --> 01:16.650
And the software that we're gonna use is called VMware.

01:16.650 --> 01:18.789
Now you can download VMware from the same page

01:18.789 --> 01:20.938
where you downloaded the custom Kali.

01:20.938 --> 01:22.683
I'm gonna include its link in the resources

01:22.683 --> 01:24.750
of this lecture as well.

01:24.750 --> 01:26.310
And we're just gonna scroll down

01:26.310 --> 01:28.380
past the Kali download links.

01:28.380 --> 01:30.330
You'll see we have a new section here

01:30.330 --> 01:32.670
that has the VMware player download links

01:32.670 --> 01:34.770
for all operating systems.

01:34.770 --> 01:36.169
And since we're installing Kali

01:36.169 --> 01:38.820
on a Linux computer in this lecture,

01:38.820 --> 01:41.160
we're gonna download the Linux version in here

01:41.160 --> 01:43.320
by clicking on this link.

01:43.320 --> 01:45.450
Click on download one more time

01:45.450 --> 01:47.223
and give it some time to download.

01:48.150 --> 01:49.206
Once the download is complete,

01:49.206 --> 01:53.040
we're gonna be able to see it here in our downloads.

01:53.040 --> 01:55.440
This is the installer for VMware,

01:55.440 --> 01:58.740
the software that we're gonna use to run virtual machines

01:58.740 --> 02:01.515
inside our current operating system.

02:01.515 --> 02:02.940
And to install it,

02:02.940 --> 02:05.430
we're first gonna need to open our terminal

02:05.430 --> 02:06.999
and navigate to the location

02:06.999 --> 02:09.720
where we have this installer downloaded,

02:09.720 --> 02:11.550
which is in my downloads.

02:11.550 --> 02:13.290
So I'm gonna use the CD command

02:13.290 --> 02:16.539
to change my working directory to downloads.

02:16.539 --> 02:19.343
And if I do ls to list all of the files,

02:19.343 --> 02:22.091
you'll see we have the file in here.

02:22.091 --> 02:24.120
And before running this file,

02:24.120 --> 02:28.260
we need to change its permissions to unexecutable.

02:28.260 --> 02:32.700
So to do that, we're gonna do chmod + x,

02:32.700 --> 02:34.203
followed by the file name.

02:35.250 --> 02:36.720
I'm gonna hit Enter.

02:36.720 --> 02:38.910
And now if I do ls,

02:38.910 --> 02:42.150
you'll notice that the file name is listed in green,

02:42.150 --> 02:45.690
meaning that this is an executable.

02:45.690 --> 02:47.760
Now, before running this executable,

02:47.760 --> 02:52.080
we're gonna have to install the Build Essentials package

02:52.080 --> 02:55.290
because it is required by this installer

02:55.290 --> 02:58.260
to install VMware for us.

02:58.260 --> 03:01.260
Now I'm doing all of these steps on Ubuntu,

03:01.260 --> 03:05.190
but installing VMware should be pretty much the same

03:05.190 --> 03:10.170
on most Linux and especially Debian based distributions.

03:10.170 --> 03:12.755
So in order to install the Build Essentials,

03:12.755 --> 03:16.033
I'm first gonna have to update the list of sources

03:16.033 --> 03:18.515
that I can download packages from.

03:18.515 --> 03:23.515
And to do that, we're gonna do sudo apt get update.

03:24.570 --> 03:26.610
I'm gonna input my password.

03:26.610 --> 03:28.560
Once the sources are updated,

03:28.560 --> 03:31.200
we're ready to install the Build Essentials.

03:31.200 --> 03:35.610
So we're gonna do sudo apt-get install

03:35.610 --> 03:39.960
build essential gcc-12.

03:39.960 --> 03:42.090
We're gonna hit Enter.

03:42.090 --> 03:43.019
I've already installed this,

03:43.019 --> 03:46.500
that's why it's automatically installing it for me.

03:46.500 --> 03:49.140
But in your case, it's gonna ask you to confirm,

03:49.140 --> 03:50.849
and all you'll have to do is simply hit Enter

03:50.849 --> 03:53.563
to confirm that you want to install it.

03:53.563 --> 03:55.710
If you don't see any errors at all,

03:55.710 --> 03:58.200
it means everything got installed properly.

03:58.200 --> 03:59.850
So I'm gonna clear the screen,

03:59.850 --> 04:01.452
and I'm gonna do ls one more time

04:01.452 --> 04:03.630
just to show you what we want to run.

04:03.630 --> 04:05.219
We wanna run this executable,

04:05.219 --> 04:07.760
which is the same file as this one.

04:07.760 --> 04:10.470
And to run executables in Linux,

04:10.470 --> 04:13.309
you simply have to do dot forward slash

04:13.309 --> 04:15.783
followed by the executable name.

04:16.650 --> 04:18.958
Now also, we need to run this as admin.

04:18.958 --> 04:22.863
Therefore, I'm gonna type sudo before the command.

04:23.880 --> 04:25.499
I'm gonna hit Enter

04:25.499 --> 04:29.820
and we're gonna give it some time to extract the installer.

04:29.820 --> 04:33.510
And once it's done, we're gonna go to all of our software

04:33.510 --> 04:35.853
and we're gonna run VMware player.

04:36.960 --> 04:39.737
We're gonna accept the agreement and click next,

04:39.737 --> 04:42.423
accept the license, next.

04:43.260 --> 04:45.750
We're gonna say we don't want to share data,

04:45.750 --> 04:48.060
and we click on finish.

04:48.060 --> 04:49.683
We're gonna put the password.

04:51.240 --> 04:53.550
And perfect, here we go.

04:53.550 --> 04:56.670
During the installation, you might also get an option

04:56.670 --> 04:58.593
to either use the free or the paid version.

04:58.593 --> 05:01.020
Make sure you select the free one

05:01.020 --> 05:03.929
because we're using it for non-commercial use.

05:03.929 --> 05:06.270
So right now, we're ready to create

05:06.270 --> 05:10.530
or open ready virtual machines using VMware.

05:10.530 --> 05:13.380
And the virtual machine that we actually want to run

05:13.380 --> 05:15.690
is the customized version of Kali

05:15.690 --> 05:19.350
that we just downloaded at the start of the video.

05:19.350 --> 05:20.183
So to do that,

05:20.183 --> 05:23.190
we're simply gonna click on open a virtual machine

05:23.190 --> 05:26.370
or go to file and open virtual machine.

05:26.370 --> 05:27.826
We're gonna navigate to the location

05:27.826 --> 05:30.360
where we downloaded this virtual machine.

05:30.360 --> 05:32.310
So we're gonna go to downloads,

05:32.310 --> 05:34.290
we're gonna double click it in here

05:34.290 --> 05:36.472
and select the only file that we can select,

05:36.472 --> 05:38.986
which is the .vmx file.

05:38.986 --> 05:41.430
We're gonna double click it.

05:41.430 --> 05:44.555
And here we go, we have it imported in here in VMware,

05:44.555 --> 05:46.226
and we can easily start it now

05:46.226 --> 05:49.053
by clicking on power on in here.

05:49.920 --> 05:52.620
Now, before doing that, I just wanna show you

05:52.620 --> 05:55.410
how to modify the virtual machine settings.

05:55.410 --> 05:57.270
You do not need to do this.

05:57.270 --> 05:59.460
I'm simply showing you how to do that

05:59.460 --> 06:02.730
so you get an idea on how to modify the settings.

06:02.730 --> 06:05.250
Because modifying virtual machine settings

06:05.250 --> 06:06.690
is always the same

06:06.690 --> 06:10.650
regardless of what type of virtual machine it is.

06:10.650 --> 06:11.722
So we're gonna click on

06:11.722 --> 06:14.070
edit virtual machine settings in here

06:14.070 --> 06:15.349
to modify the settings.

06:15.349 --> 06:18.480
And as you can see, the first thing that you can modify

06:18.480 --> 06:21.690
is the amount of memory that the virtual machine has,

06:21.690 --> 06:25.548
and you can increase it or decrease it by moving the slider.

06:25.548 --> 06:28.890
It's set to two gigabytes by default, and that is good.

06:28.890 --> 06:30.930
So I'm gonna keep it at that.

06:30.930 --> 06:32.811
Next, you can modify the number of processors

06:32.811 --> 06:34.488
that the machine has.

06:34.488 --> 06:36.969
Again, it's set to two by default.

06:36.969 --> 06:40.710
I'm gonna keep it at that because that's pretty good.

06:40.710 --> 06:43.200
You can also modify the network settings.

06:43.200 --> 06:47.940
And as you can see right now, it's set to use a NAT network.

06:47.940 --> 06:50.460
We're also gonna keep this as NAT.

06:50.460 --> 06:53.640
This is great because this setting will basically create

06:53.640 --> 06:56.652
a virtual network where my host machine

06:56.652 --> 06:59.713
is going to be the router for this network.

06:59.713 --> 07:01.984
And then all the virtual machines

07:01.984 --> 07:06.000
are going to be clients connected to this network.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.250
So they're going to get internet connection

07:08.250 --> 07:10.560
from my host machine.

07:10.560 --> 07:13.980
And at the same time, all of my virtual machines

07:13.980 --> 07:18.510
will be connected to the same virtual network.

07:18.510 --> 07:21.360
This is very handy because my virtual machines

07:21.360 --> 07:24.180
will be able to communicate with each other

07:24.180 --> 07:26.503
and therefore, will be able to use the Kali machine

07:26.503 --> 07:28.410
to hack into the others,

07:28.410 --> 07:32.670
will be able to test network attacks and do much more.

07:32.670 --> 07:34.750
So this setting will first allow my virtual machines

07:34.750 --> 07:36.780
to have internet connection,

07:36.780 --> 07:40.050
and it'll also allow them to communicate with each other

07:40.050 --> 07:43.230
through this virtual NAT network.

07:43.230 --> 07:44.880
Now, this virtual network

07:44.880 --> 07:48.840
will rely on the connection of your host computer.

07:48.840 --> 07:51.540
So it'll not need any extra interfaces,

07:51.540 --> 07:53.702
it'll not need any extra adapters.

07:53.702 --> 07:57.120
And as far as the virtual machines are concerned,

07:57.120 --> 08:00.270
they are connected to an ethernet network,

08:00.270 --> 08:04.413
but in reality, they are connected through the host machine.

08:05.310 --> 08:09.000
Finally, you can also modify the display settings in here,

08:09.000 --> 08:11.550
and I usually like to tick this option

08:11.550 --> 08:13.950
to accelerate 3D graphics.

08:13.950 --> 08:16.260
If you get issues with it, you can untick it,

08:16.260 --> 08:19.890
but usually it gives you nicer and smoother animations

08:19.890 --> 08:21.213
with virtual machines.

08:22.170 --> 08:24.030
So we're gonna save the settings

08:24.030 --> 08:27.510
and we can go ahead and start this virtual machine

08:27.510 --> 08:31.173
by selecting it and clicking on power on in here.

08:32.640 --> 08:34.300
We're gonna say I copied it

08:35.190 --> 08:37.540
and we're just gonna give it some time to load.

08:38.430 --> 08:41.760
And as you can see, if everything goes as expected,

08:41.760 --> 08:45.390
you should get the default login screen for Kali.

08:45.390 --> 08:47.070
So I'm gonna click in here

08:47.070 --> 08:50.910
and I'm gonna put the username as root, R-O-O-T,

08:50.910 --> 08:54.210
hit Enter, and the password is the reverse of that.

08:54.210 --> 08:57.090
So it's T-O-O-R.

08:57.090 --> 09:00.810
We're gonna hit Enter and give it some time.

09:00.810 --> 09:02.340
And great, as you can see,

09:02.340 --> 09:04.860
now we have another operating system,

09:04.860 --> 09:08.040
Kali Linux installed as a virtual machine

09:08.040 --> 09:12.666
inside our own main host operating system.

09:12.666 --> 09:14.337
Now we can put this in full screen

09:14.337 --> 09:16.986
by going to virtual machine in here

09:16.986 --> 09:19.503
and clicking on enter full screen.

09:20.550 --> 09:22.590
This screen should automatically resize

09:22.590 --> 09:24.180
as you can see in here.

09:24.180 --> 09:27.870
And in most cases, the icons should look normal,

09:27.870 --> 09:32.870
but in my case, they look small because I have a 4K display.

09:32.970 --> 09:36.510
So we're gonna need to manually modify the display settings.

09:36.510 --> 09:40.263
And to do that, we're gonna right click, go to settings,

09:41.844 --> 09:45.483
and we're gonna set the scale to 200.

09:46.560 --> 09:48.273
I'm gonna click on apply.

09:49.680 --> 09:51.706
We're gonna keep the changes and perfect.

09:51.706 --> 09:54.390
Now Kali looks normal for me.

09:54.390 --> 09:55.560
You don't have to do this

09:55.560 --> 09:57.510
if Kali looked normal from the start.

09:57.510 --> 09:59.850
Only if you have a high resolution screen,

09:59.850 --> 10:01.950
you might have to do this.

10:01.950 --> 10:03.426
Now, I know this operating system

10:03.426 --> 10:07.710
might look a little bit confusing and scary.

10:07.710 --> 10:09.506
But don't worry about it at all,

10:09.506 --> 10:12.271
I will teach you how to use it step by step

10:12.271 --> 10:15.000
as we go through the course.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
If you face any issues while installing Kali,

10:18.000 --> 10:20.070
check out the featured questions first.

10:20.070 --> 10:21.630
And if you don't see your answer,

10:21.630 --> 10:24.930
feel free to ask us in the QnA or in the forums

10:24.930 --> 10:29.223
and we will respond to you within a maximum of 15 hours.

10:30.270 --> 10:33.990
And to turn off Kali, you can simply click here,

10:33.990 --> 10:36.723
go to power off and power off.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.930
Click on power off one more time,

10:39.930 --> 10:41.763
and the machine will shut down.
