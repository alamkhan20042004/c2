00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:01.610
<v Instructor>As I mentioned,</v>

2
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.010
this course is going to be highly practical.

3
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.240
Therefore you will need a lab,

4
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.660
a place where you can practice and experiment

5
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.103
with the things that you're going to learn in the course.

6
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.020
Not only that,

7
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.350
but having a lab is essential for hackers or pen testers

8
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.400
because let's say you discovered a new attack

9
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.770
or you want to experiment with a new attack

10
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.110
or you learn something new online, and you want to test it.

11
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.560
Then the perfect place for you to test this

12
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.803
and practice hacking is a hacking or a testing lab.

13
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.230
Now to create a lab,

14
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.870
you just need the number of computers with different

15
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.440
operating systems and you will need a number of networks

16
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.550
if you're testing network attacks.

17
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.900
And if you're testing website attacks,

18
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.690
then you will need to install websites on these computers.

19
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.560
Or you can do all of this inside your computer,

20
00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.670
inside one machine and install everything else

21
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.800
as virtual machines.

22
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.110
And this is what we're going to do.

23
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.630
So let's say you have your computer right here.

24
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.890
This is your main computer that you use every day

25
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.820
to check your emails or even to watch this course,

26
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.580
this computer might be running Windows or OS X or Linux,

27
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.720
it doesn't really matter, it can run any operating system.

28
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.530
You can keep all the programs that you love and like,

29
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.530
and install a virtualization software such as virtual box,

30
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.070
or VMware, a virtualization software,

31
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.640
allow us to create a number of virtual computers

32
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.970
inside your main computer.

33
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.400
So we can have three or four or five or 10 computers

34
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.720
all installed inside your main operating system,

35
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.623
inside your main computer.

36
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.680
The really cool thing about this is you will not need

37
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.200
a number of computers.

38
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.983
You can do everything inside a single computer.

39
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.440
So what we're going to do

40
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.840
is we're gonna have a hacking machine.

41
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.700
This is going to be the machine that we will use

42
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.500
in order to hack into other machines.

43
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.880
We're going to install Kali Linux on it

44
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.503
and we'll talk about what that is later on.

45
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.550
And we're going to have two target machines,

46
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.570
these are machines that we're gonna try to hack into

47
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.510
and practice hacking against.

48
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.850
One of them is gonna be running Windows

49
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.030
and the other one is going to be running an operating system

50
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.660
called Metasploitable

51
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.083
and we will talk about that once we get to it.

52
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.510
Now it is very important to understand

53
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.600
that you will not lose any functionality

54
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.800
when you install an operating system as a virtual machine,

55
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.470
you can use that machine exactly

56
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.193
as if it's a real physical machine.

57
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.780
So the really cool thing about using virtual machines,

58
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.100
first of all, you're not gonna lose any functionality.

59
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.750
Second, all the machines are going to be isolated.

60
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.440
So as we go through the course,

61
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.270
we're gonna be trying to hack into these machines

62
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.060
and we might actually break one of them, but that's fine.

63
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.430
It will not affect your host machine.

64
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.740
You will be able to easily fix this and go back

65
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.860
to a snapshot of when the machine was working

66
00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.903
without affecting your main computer.

67
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.000
The other cool thing is that you'll be able to have a number

68
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.960
of different versions of each these machines

69
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.690
and you'll be able to change the configuration easily,

70
00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.720
change the network settings,

71
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.350
or switch between different states of these machines

72
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.423
and so on.

73
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.700
So by using virtualization,

74
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.000
you will not lose any functionality,

75
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.173
but you will gain so many cool features.

76
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.820
And the main thing to keep in mind is your host machine,

77
00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.660
your main computer will never be affected.

78
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.690
It's completely isolated.

79
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.300
And if we break any of these machines,

80
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.510
nothing will happen to your precious computer

81
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.920
that you use every day.

82
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.710
And this way you can always use your host machine

83
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.010
for daily use, for checking emails, watching the videos,

84
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.180
doing whatever you do normally,

85
00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.000
and then use your virtual machines for hacking

86
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.733
and practicing the attacks.

87
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.710
And this is what we're gonna be doing in this course.

88
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.543
So right here,

89
00:04:26.543 --> 00:04:28.440
I have a Windows computer

90
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.410
that does not contain any hacking tools.

91
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.820
So I can't really use it for hacking,

92
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.190
but I have a virtualization software called VMware

93
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.600
installed on it.

94
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.670
And this software allows me to run multiple

95
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.970
operating systems as virtual machines

96
00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.020
within this host computer.

97
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.450
So I can use the host computer for my data use

98
00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.610
and then use the virtual machines

99
00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.770
for whatever use I want for testing or for hacking.

100
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.760
So if I zoom in here on the left,

101
00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.980
you can see that I have a Kali Linux installed.

102
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.240
This is an operating system that we will use for hacking.

103
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.660
You can see I have another windows computer.

104
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.470
You can see that I have Linux.

105
00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.990
All of it installed as virtual machines,

106
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.750
and then we're gonna be using these

107
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.080
as we go through the course for hacking

108
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.690
or for testing without affecting

109
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.983
our main host operating system, this windows computer.

110
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.490
Now don't worry about any of this,

111
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.570
in the next lectures I will show you in details

112
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.440
how to install this virtualization software, VMware,

113
00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.310
on all of the major operating systems, on Windows,

114
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.243
Linux or Apple macOS.

115
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.420
As we go through the course,

116
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.860
I will also show you in details

117
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.860
how to install these operating systems

118
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.783
as virtual machines within VMware.
