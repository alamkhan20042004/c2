00:00.180 --> 00:02.190
Instructor: The first operating system

00:02.190 --> 00:07.190
that we're going to install in our lab is Kali Linux.

00:07.530 --> 00:09.150
See, throughout the course,

00:09.150 --> 00:12.780
we're going to use a number of hacking tools.

00:12.780 --> 00:15.750
You can install each of these tools manually,

00:15.750 --> 00:19.830
or you can do what most hackers do, including myself,

00:19.830 --> 00:23.580
and save time and effort and use an operating system

00:23.580 --> 00:25.023
designed for hacking.

00:25.920 --> 00:29.550
We're gonna use an operating system called Kali Linux.

00:29.550 --> 00:32.550
It's a Linux distro based on Debian,

00:32.550 --> 00:34.890
and the only difference between Kali

00:34.890 --> 00:38.310
and the actual original Debian Linux distro

00:38.310 --> 00:41.068
is the fact that Kali has a lot of hacking

00:41.068 --> 00:44.346
and penetration testing tools pre-installed

00:44.346 --> 00:46.860
and pre-configured in it.

00:46.860 --> 00:49.260
Therefore, once you install Kali,

00:49.260 --> 00:52.560
you will have access to so many hacking tools

00:52.560 --> 00:55.920
without the need to install or configure any of them,

00:55.920 --> 00:59.730
which will save you a lot of time and a lot of effort.

00:59.730 --> 01:01.536
Now, just like any other operating system,

01:01.536 --> 01:04.350
you can install it as a main machine

01:04.350 --> 01:07.140
or as a virtual machine.

01:07.140 --> 01:09.990
Now, I'm going to install it as a virtual machine,

01:09.990 --> 01:13.050
because like I explained in the previous lecture,

01:13.050 --> 01:14.960
we will not lose any functionality

01:14.960 --> 01:18.510
by using operating systems as virtual machines,

01:18.510 --> 01:20.790
and it comes with a lot of benefits

01:20.790 --> 01:23.647
because it's completely isolated from our computer

01:23.647 --> 01:26.734
that we always use, so if we break the virtual machine

01:26.734 --> 01:29.490
or if we want to delete it and reset it,

01:29.490 --> 01:32.613
it will not affect our main operating system.

01:33.720 --> 01:35.280
Now, the first thing that you wanna do

01:35.280 --> 01:38.280
is download the virtual image of Kali Linux,

01:38.280 --> 01:42.090
so you can download it from the resources of this lecture.

01:42.090 --> 01:44.970
To access the resources of the current lecture,

01:44.970 --> 01:47.460
we're gonna scroll down to the lecture,

01:47.460 --> 01:50.490
we're gonna click on the resources icon,

01:50.490 --> 01:53.373
and then we're gonna click on the resource that we want.

01:55.680 --> 01:58.140
Now, before going ahead with this,

01:58.140 --> 02:00.000
I want to highlight something

02:00.000 --> 02:04.530
that is very, very, very important, so please pay attention.

02:04.530 --> 02:09.530
This is a custom Kali image that I made for my courses.

02:09.780 --> 02:13.110
It is smoother and faster than the original one,

02:13.110 --> 02:14.871
it fixes a number of bugs,

02:14.871 --> 02:18.870
and it contains a number of extra programs

02:18.870 --> 02:20.700
that we need for this course

02:20.700 --> 02:24.273
and are not included in the original release.

02:25.200 --> 02:28.350
You do not have to use this custom image.

02:28.350 --> 02:30.750
You can use the original one.

02:30.750 --> 02:34.620
You can even use just a normal Linux distribution

02:34.620 --> 02:38.190
as long as you know how to manually install

02:38.190 --> 02:39.900
all of the missing programs

02:39.900 --> 02:43.320
and apply the fixes that I did myself,

02:43.320 --> 02:46.653
and you can see a full list of them here on the left.

02:48.210 --> 02:52.200
Therefore, if you ask us a question in the Q and A section

02:52.200 --> 02:54.450
and you're not using the custom image,

02:54.450 --> 02:55.948
the first thing that we will ask you

02:55.948 --> 03:00.420
is to use the custom Kali image that we made for you,

03:00.420 --> 03:03.570
because we will not know the changes you made

03:03.570 --> 03:05.700
in order to fix it.

03:05.700 --> 03:08.340
So if you have a 64-bit computer,

03:08.340 --> 03:10.890
download it from one of these links,

03:10.890 --> 03:13.590
or if you have a 32=bit computer,

03:13.590 --> 03:16.833
then download the 32-bit version from here.

03:17.700 --> 03:21.030
For Apple users, if you have an Apple computer,

03:21.030 --> 03:23.550
then you should download the 64-bit version

03:23.550 --> 03:25.800
if you have an older Apple computer

03:25.800 --> 03:29.220
that uses a 64-bit processor,

03:29.220 --> 03:31.190
or if you have a newer Apple computer

03:31.190 --> 03:36.190
with a Silicon ARM chip, like the M1, M2, M3, and so on,

03:37.260 --> 03:38.894
then make sure you download the version

03:38.894 --> 03:43.053
that is made specifically for your computer from here.

03:44.430 --> 03:45.960
While waiting on the download,

03:45.960 --> 03:48.870
check out our VIP community right here

03:48.870 --> 03:50.640
and our YouTube channel.

03:50.640 --> 03:54.150
We actually post hacking content on it regularly,

03:54.150 --> 03:56.430
so you'll probably find this very, very useful,

03:56.430 --> 03:58.860
so make sure you subscribe to stay updated

03:58.860 --> 04:01.800
with the latest stuff that we post in here.

04:01.800 --> 04:03.840
Once the download is complete,

04:03.840 --> 04:08.280
you'll be ready to install Kali as a virtual machine.

04:08.280 --> 04:11.250
I will walk you through that in the next lectures.

04:11.250 --> 04:15.510
but before moving on, we need to enable virtualization

04:15.510 --> 04:17.670
to run virtual machines.

04:17.670 --> 04:21.690
You only need to do that if you're running Windows or Linux.

04:21.690 --> 04:25.860
You do not need to do this if you're running Apple MacOS,

04:25.860 --> 04:27.485
as Apple computers come

04:27.485 --> 04:31.230
with virtualization enabled by default.

04:31.230 --> 04:33.240
so skip the rest of this lecture

04:33.240 --> 04:35.760
if you're using an Apple computer.

04:35.760 --> 04:37.860
If you're using Windows or Linux,

04:37.860 --> 04:41.460
then continue with me to see how to enable it.

04:41.460 --> 04:43.950
So on Windows, before enabling it,

04:43.950 --> 04:46.890
if you wanna check if it is already enabled,

04:46.890 --> 04:49.023
you're gonna have to go to the start menu.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.843
We're gonna look for the task manager.

04:53.490 --> 04:54.753
I have it right here.

04:56.070 --> 04:58.890
I'm gonna click on more details,

04:58.890 --> 05:01.320
I'm gonna go on performance,

05:01.320 --> 05:05.460
and if you look in here beside virtualization,

05:05.460 --> 05:07.560
if it's saying enabled for you,

05:07.560 --> 05:09.540
then you can skip the rest of this lecture

05:09.540 --> 05:11.490
and move on to the next lecture.

05:11.490 --> 05:14.640
If it's saying disabled, then continue with this lecture

05:14.640 --> 05:18.840
to learn how to enable virtualization.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.880
So to do that, we're gonna have

05:20.880 --> 05:23.250
to first restart the computer,

05:23.250 --> 05:26.280
and as it's booting, as it's starting,

05:26.280 --> 05:29.040
you're gonna have to press a key combination,

05:29.040 --> 05:32.190
usually one of the F keys from your keyboard,

05:32.190 --> 05:34.020
to enter the BIOS settings,

05:34.020 --> 05:36.150
and from there, we can enable it,

05:36.150 --> 05:37.980
so let me show you how to do it.

05:37.980 --> 05:39.930
Keep in mind, you only need to do this

05:39.930 --> 05:42.540
if virtualization is disabled.

05:42.540 --> 05:44.746
If it's enabled, then you can simply skip this

05:44.746 --> 05:47.523
and continue with the rest of the course.

05:48.390 --> 05:50.490
Entering the BIOS settings varies depending

05:50.490 --> 05:52.146
on the computer that you have

05:52.146 --> 05:54.270
and depending on the motherboard.

05:54.270 --> 05:55.710
On the right here, I have a table

05:55.710 --> 05:58.530
of the most common computers

05:58.530 --> 06:01.080
along with the buttons that you need to press

06:01.080 --> 06:03.840
in order to enter the BIOS settings,

06:03.840 --> 06:07.410
so as soon as you turn on the computer or restart it,

06:07.410 --> 06:11.100
you'll need to press the button relevant to your computer

06:11.100 --> 06:14.670
in here in order to enter the BIOS settings.

06:14.670 --> 06:16.380
Once you're there, you wanna make sure

06:16.380 --> 06:18.660
you enable virtualization,

06:18.660 --> 06:22.023
so let me show you how to do this on a real computer.

06:23.010 --> 06:25.290
This is a Lenovo computer,

06:25.290 --> 06:28.380
therefore, based on the table that I just showed you,

06:28.380 --> 06:33.030
I will need to press F2 as soon as I turn on this computer

06:33.030 --> 06:35.883
in order to enter into its BIOS settings.

06:36.720 --> 06:39.930
So first, I'm gonna hit the power button to turn it on,

06:39.930 --> 06:43.230
and as it's being turned on, I'm gonna keep pressing F2

06:43.230 --> 06:46.543
to enter the settings, and perfect.

06:46.543 --> 06:50.340
As you can see, I am in the BIOS settings right now.

06:50.340 --> 06:53.340
Now, keep in mind, depending on your computer,

06:53.340 --> 06:57.390
the settings might look different than what I have in here.

06:57.390 --> 06:59.340
The main thing you need to keep in mind

06:59.340 --> 07:01.863
is to enable virtualization.

07:02.730 --> 07:04.556
This option can be found in a different window

07:04.556 --> 07:07.140
in any of these windows or tabs,

07:07.140 --> 07:09.270
but the main thing you wanna keep in mind is

07:09.270 --> 07:14.160
to look for an option called virtualization, VT-x, AMD-V,

07:14.160 --> 07:18.060
or any of the options in here and enable it.

07:18.060 --> 07:20.436
So as you can see, for me, the first window that I see

07:20.436 --> 07:22.950
is just an information window.

07:22.950 --> 07:26.190
It doesn't really allow me to modify anything.

07:26.190 --> 07:28.260
Now, you can use the keyboard to navigate

07:28.260 --> 07:30.570
between these windows or these tabs,

07:30.570 --> 07:32.730
so I'm gonna press the right arrow

07:32.730 --> 07:35.580
to go to the configuration window,

07:35.580 --> 07:38.193
and in here, the only thing that I wanna modify

07:38.193 --> 07:41.940
is Intel virtualization technology,

07:41.940 --> 07:46.080
so I'm gonna use the down arrow to navigate to that,

07:46.080 --> 07:48.570
and I'm gonna hit enter to change the setting,

07:48.570 --> 07:50.700
press down to set it to enabled,

07:50.700 --> 07:53.160
and hit enter again to select it.

07:53.160 --> 07:55.390
Now, if you're not sure about how to use this interface,

07:55.390 --> 07:56.730
because like I said,

07:56.730 --> 07:59.490
you might actually get a different interface,

07:59.490 --> 08:02.610
keep an eye on the instructions that you see at the bottom,

08:02.610 --> 08:04.452
as they tell you exactly how to navigate

08:04.452 --> 08:07.290
and modify the settings.

08:07.290 --> 08:09.480
Now, I'm done with the configuration window.

08:09.480 --> 08:11.640
I'm gonna press the right arrow again

08:11.640 --> 08:13.740
to go into the security tab.

08:13.740 --> 08:15.060
We're gonna go to the exit,

08:15.060 --> 08:18.630
so again, I'm gonna press the right arrow again,

08:18.630 --> 08:23.250
and I'm gonna select the first option, exit saving settings.

08:23.250 --> 08:25.350
It's gonna ask me, do I really wanna do this?

08:25.350 --> 08:27.120
I'm gonna say yes.

08:27.120 --> 08:30.570
The computer will restart with virtualization enabled,

08:30.570 --> 08:32.190
so in the next lectures

08:32.190 --> 08:34.710
when we get to installing virtual machines,

08:34.710 --> 08:37.833
these virtual machines will run with no issues.

08:39.150 --> 08:41.040
If you've done everything properly,

08:41.040 --> 08:46.040
now if you go again to the Task Manager, go to performance,

08:46.680 --> 08:49.893
you should see that virtualization is enabled.

08:51.090 --> 08:52.170
If you couldn't do that,

08:52.170 --> 08:54.300
please ask us in the Q and A section,

08:54.300 --> 08:56.730
and we'll be happy to help you.

08:56.730 --> 08:59.220
Keep in mind that you only need to do this

08:59.220 --> 09:03.570
if you're running Windows or Linux as the host computer

09:03.570 --> 09:04.983
on your main computer.

09:06.120 --> 09:08.790
If you're running Apple MacOS,

09:08.790 --> 09:10.380
then you do not need to do this,

09:10.380 --> 09:12.363
and you should have skipped this part.
