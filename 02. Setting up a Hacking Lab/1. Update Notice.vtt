00:00.840 --> 00:01.890
Instructor: From now onwards,

00:01.890 --> 00:05.400
we're gonna dive into the practical portion of the course

00:05.400 --> 00:07.200
and you're going to learn everything

00:07.200 --> 00:09.510
through real life examples.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.640
Please note that this course has been kept

00:11.640 --> 00:13.860
constantly up to date.

00:13.860 --> 00:16.470
With every update, we test everything

00:16.470 --> 00:20.220
that is covered in this course against the latest systems

00:20.220 --> 00:24.450
at three different locations with three different setups.

00:24.450 --> 00:27.600
You can actually check when the course was last updated

00:27.600 --> 00:30.780
by looking at the overview in here

00:30.780 --> 00:33.750
and scrolling down to the description portion.

00:33.750 --> 00:35.490
Look at the last updated,

00:35.490 --> 00:38.913
and you'll see here when was the course last updated.

00:39.780 --> 00:43.260
Also, with every update, I usually send an announcement

00:43.260 --> 00:46.650
that details what exactly have been updated.

00:46.650 --> 00:49.290
You can view this announcement in your email

00:49.290 --> 00:52.053
or in the announcements tab in here.

00:53.220 --> 00:54.053
So as you can see,

00:54.053 --> 00:57.120
the last announcement was sent nine days ago.

00:57.120 --> 00:59.160
I pushed another course update,

00:59.160 --> 01:02.017
it details which course this was pushed to,

01:02.017 --> 01:04.980
the amount of lectures that were updated,

01:04.980 --> 01:08.640
the reason, and also the exact lecture numbers

01:08.640 --> 01:11.340
and lecture titles that were updated.

01:11.340 --> 01:14.370
And if I scroll down, you can see all the previous updates.

01:14.370 --> 01:15.900
So I have an update here a month ago.

01:15.900 --> 01:17.970
Again, another update, scroll down,

01:17.970 --> 01:20.880
another update a month ago, and so on.

01:20.880 --> 01:22.860
So you can see a quick change log

01:22.860 --> 01:26.010
of how the course has evolved in here.

01:26.010 --> 01:28.260
So if anything didn't work for you,

01:28.260 --> 01:31.020
it is probably because you are missing something

01:31.020 --> 01:33.840
or because you're not doing something properly.

01:33.840 --> 01:37.050
So just ask us in the Q&amp;A in here

01:37.050 --> 01:40.380
and we'll respond to you within less than 15 hours.

01:40.380 --> 01:42.540
You can also check out the featured questions

01:42.540 --> 01:45.570
just in case your question falls under this,

01:45.570 --> 01:47.850
as you will already have an answer ready

01:47.850 --> 01:50.550
before you even ask the question.

01:50.550 --> 01:53.580
Keep in mind, guys, that we are trying to hack into systems

01:53.580 --> 01:55.920
designed by very smart people.

01:55.920 --> 01:58.410
We're also using different operating systems

01:58.410 --> 01:59.580
and different setups,

01:59.580 --> 02:01.470
so it is normal to face issues

02:01.470 --> 02:03.660
and it's actually part of the learning experience

02:03.660 --> 02:06.480
to be able to diagnose these issues and fix them.

02:06.480 --> 02:08.520
And like I said, we are here to help.

02:08.520 --> 02:11.460
If you face any questions, just don't be afraid to ask us

02:11.460 --> 02:13.443
and we will try our best to help you.
