00:00:00.877 --> 00:00:01.991
<v Instructor>In the previous lectures,</v>

2
00:00:01.991 --> 00:00:05.835
we seen how to crack the WEP encryption in minutes

3
00:00:05.835 --> 00:00:09.974
even if the target network is not busy.

4
00:00:09.974 --> 00:00:11.940
Now, in the next lectures,

5
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.543
we will talk about cracking WPA and WPA2.

6
00:00:17.487 --> 00:00:18.380
First of all,

7
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.424
before we start talking about

8
00:00:19.424 --> 00:00:21.249
how to crack these encryptions,

9
00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:23.609
it is very important to understand

10
00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.629
that both of them are very, very similar.

11
00:00:26.629 --> 00:00:29.991
The only difference between them is the encryption used

12
00:00:29.991 --> 00:00:32.560
to ensure message integrity.

13
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.959
WPA uses TKIP,

14
00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:39.959
and WPA2 uses an encryption called CCMP.

15
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.993
In any case,

16
00:00:40.993 --> 00:00:44.401
this does not affect the methods that we're gonna use

17
00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:47.898
to crack WPA and WPA2.

18
00:00:47.898 --> 00:00:49.639
Therefore, all of the methods

19
00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:52.261
that I'm gonna show you from now on will work

20
00:00:52.261 --> 00:00:57.166
on both WPA and WPA2.

21
00:00:57.166 --> 00:01:00.247
Now, both of these encryptions came after WEP

22
00:01:00.247 --> 00:01:04.759
and they were designed to address the weaknesses in it.

23
00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:07.676
Therefore, both of them are much more secure

24
00:01:07.676 --> 00:01:11.136
and cracking them is more challenging.

25
00:01:11.136 --> 00:01:14.517
So before we start talking about how to crack them,

26
00:01:14.517 --> 00:01:19.245
I want to cover a feature that if enabled and misconfigured,

27
00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:22.265
can be exploited to recover the key

28
00:01:22.265 --> 00:01:26.389
without having to crack the actual encryption.

29
00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:28.776
The feature is called WPS.

30
00:01:28.776 --> 00:01:32.397
It allows devices to connect to the network easily

31
00:01:32.397 --> 00:01:36.840
without having to enter the key for the network.

32
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.868
So it was designed to simplify the process

33
00:01:38.868 --> 00:01:42.647
of connecting printers and such devices.

34
00:01:42.647 --> 00:01:44.983
You can actually see a WPS button

35
00:01:44.983 --> 00:01:48.203
on most wireless enabled printers.

36
00:01:48.203 --> 00:01:49.624
If this button is pressed

37
00:01:49.624 --> 00:01:52.999
and then you press the WPS button on the router,

38
00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:56.170
you'll notice that the printer will connect to the router

39
00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.720
without you having to enter the key.

40
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.553
This way,

41
00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:04.510
the authentication is done using an eight digit pin.

42
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.343
So you can think of this

43
00:02:05.343 --> 00:02:08.249
as a password made up of only numbers

44
00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:11.693
and the length of this password is only eight.

45
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.890
So this actually gives us a relatively small list

46
00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.407
of possible passwords

47
00:02:16.407 --> 00:02:19.745
and we can try all of these possible passwords

48
00:02:19.745 --> 00:02:22.203
within a relatively short time.

49
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.094
Once we get this pin,

50
00:02:24.094 --> 00:02:27.812
it can be used to recover the actual WPA

51
00:02:27.812 --> 00:02:29.853
or WPA2 key.

52
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.348
So as you can see with this method,

53
00:02:32.348 --> 00:02:35.690
we are not exploiting WPA or WPA2.

54
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.168
We are actually exploiting a feature

55
00:02:38.168 --> 00:02:42.450
that can be enabled on these encryptions.

56
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.283
So for this to work,

57
00:02:43.283 --> 00:02:44.220
first of all,

58
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.623
we need WPS to be enabled on the network

59
00:02:46.623 --> 00:02:48.897
because it can't be disabled.

60
00:02:48.897 --> 00:02:51.411
Also, it needs to be misconfigured.

61
00:02:51.411 --> 00:02:53.112
So it needs to be configured

62
00:02:53.112 --> 00:02:55.613
to use a normal pin authentication

63
00:02:55.613 --> 00:02:58.672
and not a push button authentication.

64
00:02:58.672 --> 00:03:00.951
If push button authentication is used,

65
00:03:00.951 --> 00:03:04.642
then the router will refuse any pins that we try

66
00:03:04.642 --> 00:03:09.150
unless the WPS button is pressed on the router.

67
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.763
Therefore, the method will not work

68
00:03:10.763 --> 00:03:13.703
if push button or PBC is enabled.

69
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.264
So in most modern routers,

70
00:03:16.264 --> 00:03:18.420
PBC comes enabled by default

71
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.159
or WPS will be disabled by default

72
00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:23.730
so this method might not work.

73
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.498
But because WPA and WPA2 are so secure and so challenging,

74
00:03:28.498 --> 00:03:32.988
it is always a good idea to check if WPS is enabled

75
00:03:32.988 --> 00:03:34.885
and try the method that I'm gonna show you

76
00:03:34.885 --> 00:03:36.265
to crack the network.

77
00:03:36.265 --> 00:03:37.131
If it fails,

78
00:03:37.131 --> 00:03:40.630
then you can try the other methods that I'm gonna show you

79
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.063
after the next lecture.
