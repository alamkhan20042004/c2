00:00.662 --> 00:02.520
-: Now as I promised you,

00:02.520 --> 00:05.370
this course is going to be highly practical,

00:05.370 --> 00:08.763
but I also promised that I will not neglect the theory.

00:09.900 --> 00:14.220
Now what we mean by hacking is being able to gain access

00:14.220 --> 00:18.180
to a system that you're not supposed to have access to.

00:18.180 --> 00:21.240
So for example, logging into an email account

00:21.240 --> 00:23.700
that you're not supposed to have access to

00:23.700 --> 00:26.013
is considered hacking that account.

00:26.880 --> 00:29.880
Gaining access to a remote computer that you're not

00:29.880 --> 00:33.480
supposed to have access to is hacking that computer.

00:33.480 --> 00:36.150
Reading information that you're not supposed to

00:36.150 --> 00:39.363
be able to read, again is considered hacking.

00:40.350 --> 00:43.980
So you can see that there is a large number of ways to hack

00:43.980 --> 00:46.710
into a system, and the word hacking can refer

00:46.710 --> 00:50.850
to a number of things, but the main concept is the same.

00:50.850 --> 00:53.970
Gaining access or being able to do things that

00:53.970 --> 00:58.560
you're not supposed to be able to do is considered hacking.

00:58.560 --> 01:01.110
Now, there are three main types of hackers.

01:01.110 --> 01:02.850
We have the black-hat hackers.

01:02.850 --> 01:06.510
These are the bad people that hack systems illegally

01:06.510 --> 01:08.190
in order to steal money

01:08.190 --> 01:11.193
or to achieve their own illegal goals.

01:12.060 --> 01:15.330
The second part of hackers are the white-hat hackers.

01:15.330 --> 01:17.070
So this is us.

01:17.070 --> 01:19.710
These people use the same techniques used

01:19.710 --> 01:23.790
by the black-hat hackers, and they also hack into systems,

01:23.790 --> 01:26.280
but they only hack into systems

01:26.280 --> 01:28.650
that they have permission to hack

01:28.650 --> 01:31.953
in order to test the security of these systems.

01:32.910 --> 01:36.390
And finally, we have the gray-hat hackers.

01:36.390 --> 01:38.580
These are a mixture of the two.

01:38.580 --> 01:41.010
So they'll hack into any system, even if they

01:41.010 --> 01:44.880
don't have permission to test the security of the system,

01:44.880 --> 01:48.480
but they will never steal money or damage that system.

01:48.480 --> 01:50.490
And in most cases, they'll go ahead

01:50.490 --> 01:53.700
and tell the administrator of that system.

01:53.700 --> 01:56.100
But what they do is still illegal

01:56.100 --> 01:58.230
because they test the security

01:58.230 --> 02:00.660
of systems that they do not own

02:00.660 --> 02:02.853
or do not have permission to test.

02:03.840 --> 02:06.817
Now one big question that people always ask is,

02:06.817 --> 02:07.650
"Why hacking?

02:07.650 --> 02:09.690
Why teach or learn hacking?"

02:09.690 --> 02:12.090
Well, hacking is an existing industry.

02:12.090 --> 02:15.270
There are lots of job opportunities for ethical hackers,

02:15.270 --> 02:18.570
for people like us who would go ahead and test the security

02:18.570 --> 02:21.900
of systems to make sure that these systems are secure

02:21.900 --> 02:24.960
and not vulnerable to black-hat hackers.

02:24.960 --> 02:26.520
There is actually a huge demand

02:26.520 --> 02:28.350
for ethical hackers these days

02:28.350 --> 02:32.130
because of the increased amount of hacking attacks.

02:32.130 --> 02:34.710
So we hear on the daily big systems

02:34.710 --> 02:37.230
and big companies are getting hacked.

02:37.230 --> 02:39.300
Not so long ago, Uber got hacked

02:39.300 --> 02:44.300
and information of more than 56 million users were exposed.

02:44.400 --> 02:47.430
So companies like Uber, Facebook, and Google,

02:47.430 --> 02:50.400
they hire hackers in order to try and hack

02:50.400 --> 02:53.730
into their systems and tell them where the weaknesses are

02:53.730 --> 02:55.560
so that they can fix it.

02:55.560 --> 02:58.140
They also have bug bounty programs where they

02:58.140 --> 03:01.380
literally ask all the hackers around the world to go ahead

03:01.380 --> 03:02.970
and try to hack into their websites

03:02.970 --> 03:05.490
and with their web applications, and if they could,

03:05.490 --> 03:08.313
they will pay them a bounty for the bugs that they find.
