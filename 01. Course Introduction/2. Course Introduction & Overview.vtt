<v ->Hello</v>

2
00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:02.820
and welcome.

3
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:03.880
My name is Zaid,

4
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.320
I'm an ethical worker or computer scientist

5
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.470
and I'll be your instructor in this course.

6
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.700
In this course I'm gonna teach you

7
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.730
ethical hacking from scratch so

8
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.040
I'm gonna assume that you have no prior knowledge

9
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.630
and by the end of it you will be

10
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.280
at a high intermediate level.

11
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.810
So we'll start by teaching you

12
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.440
how to set up a penetration testing lab

13
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.680
and how to install the needed software

14
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.793
so you can practice hacking safely.

15
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.820
Once done, the course is divided

16
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.900
into four main penetration testing sections.

17
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.590
The first is the network hacking section

18
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.640
where you learn how networks work,

19
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.010
how devices communicate with each other

20
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.980
and how to exploit this method

21
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.410
of communication to control all

22
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.970
the connections around you, crack wifi keys

23
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.280
and gain access to wifi networks

24
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.140
whether they use WEP/ WPA or WPA2

25
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.790
and intercept data to capture usernames,

26
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.650
passwords, chat messages or anything

27
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.473
that anybody does on the same network.

28
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.610
Once done with this, we'll move

29
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.670
to the gaining access section where

30
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.400
you'll learn how to gain access to servers

31
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.660
and personal computers.

32
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.620
So first, you'll learn how to gather

33
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.350
comprehensive information about your target,

34
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.130
discover vulnerabilities

35
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.220
and exploit them to gain full control

36
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.683
over the target system.

37
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.200
Not only that but you'll also learn

38
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.130
how to generate undetectable back doors

39
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.900
and use social engineering to deliver

40
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.900
them to your target as a fake update

41
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.530
or as a PDF or an image or any other file

42
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.060
that they might be interested in.

43
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.620
You'll also learn how to spoof emails

44
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.750
so when they're delivered to your target

45
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.350
they appear as if they're sent from a friend,

46
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.030
from their boss or from any address

47
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.223
that they are likely to interact with.

48
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.640
Once done with all of this, we'll move

49
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.080
to the post exploitation section

50
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.010
where you'll learn what can you do

51
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.010
with the access that you gained

52
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.210
in the previous sections.

53
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.560
So you'll learn how to interact

54
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.890
with the file system, how to execute

55
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.090
system commands, record keystrokes, open the webcam

56
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.880
and even use the hacked computer

57
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.003
as a pivot to hack into other computers.

58
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.350
Once done with all of these, we'll move

59
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.330
to the website hacking section

60
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.470
where you'll learn how websites work,

61
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.950
how to gather comprehensive information

62
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.950
about a target website

63
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.360
and how to discover and exploit

64
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.940
a number of dangerous vulnerabilities

65
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.810
that allow you to gain full control

66
00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.463
over the target website.

67
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.550
At the end of each section, you'll learn

68
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.090
how to secure systems

69
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.953
and secure yourself from the discussed attacks.
