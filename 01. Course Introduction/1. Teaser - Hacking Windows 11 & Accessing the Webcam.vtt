00:00.150 --> 00:03.060
-: Now, before we dive into the course content,

00:03.060 --> 00:04.860
I'd like to give you a teaser

00:04.860 --> 00:07.500
or a taste of what you'll be able to do

00:07.500 --> 00:09.660
by the end of the course.

00:09.660 --> 00:12.840
So this is going to be one example that's based

00:12.840 --> 00:17.760
on one topic that's covered in one subsection of the course.

00:17.760 --> 00:19.830
Now, because this is a teaser lecture,

00:19.830 --> 00:22.380
I'm not gonna explain the technical aspect

00:22.380 --> 00:23.850
of how am I doing this

00:23.850 --> 00:26.070
because I'm gonna teach you how to do this

00:26.070 --> 00:27.900
as you go through the course.

00:27.900 --> 00:31.110
For now, just sit back and enjoy this lecture.

00:31.110 --> 00:33.180
And after this lecture, we're gonna dive

00:33.180 --> 00:35.430
into the course content where you learn how

00:35.430 --> 00:38.670
to do things like this and much, much more.

00:38.670 --> 00:39.750
So in this example,

00:39.750 --> 00:42.570
we're gonna be hacking this Windows 11 computer

00:42.570 --> 00:44.343
from this hacking machine.

00:45.619 --> 00:46.530
In the first section of the course,

00:46.530 --> 00:49.080
I'm gonna show you how to set up your hacking lab

00:49.080 --> 00:50.610
including this hacking machine

00:50.610 --> 00:52.560
and the Target Windows machine.

00:52.560 --> 00:56.340
But for now, what I wanna do is I wanna hack this computer

00:56.340 --> 00:58.173
from this hacking machine.

00:59.070 --> 01:00.870
Now, the attack that I'm gonna show you right now

01:00.870 --> 01:03.270
and everything that I show you throughout the course works

01:03.270 --> 01:06.630
on Windows 11 and Windows 10 and previous versions

01:06.630 --> 01:10.530
but for now I'm using Windows 11 because it's the latest.

01:10.530 --> 01:12.630
And the way that I'm gonna hack that computer,

01:12.630 --> 01:16.410
mainly I'm gonna be using a framework called Beef.

01:16.410 --> 01:20.479
Beef is a browser exploitation framework that allow us

01:20.479 --> 01:24.000
to run a number of attacks against a target browser.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.310
Now, for us to be able to use Beef,

01:26.310 --> 01:30.450
we have to inject beef's code into the target browser.

01:30.450 --> 01:32.880
So we have to actually inject Beef's code

01:32.880 --> 01:35.790
into the browser of the target computer,

01:35.790 --> 01:38.340
which happens to be Chrome in this example.

01:38.340 --> 01:41.400
Now we're gonna use another program called Better Cap

01:41.400 --> 01:45.450
in order to inject Beef's hook code automatically

01:45.450 --> 01:47.460
into the target browser.

01:47.460 --> 01:49.920
So the target user will not even know

01:49.920 --> 01:52.650
that they clicked or did something suspicious.

01:52.650 --> 01:55.830
Now I've already configured Better Cap to do that,

01:55.830 --> 01:57.360
so I'm simply just gonna run it

01:57.360 --> 01:59.410
by giving it my network interface

02:00.468 --> 02:03.900
and giving it a script that I'm calling here spoof.cap.

02:03.900 --> 02:06.510
That will place me in the middle of the connections,

02:06.510 --> 02:10.440
allowing better cap to inject the hook code

02:10.440 --> 02:13.770
of Beef into the browser of the target.

02:13.770 --> 02:15.150
Now I'm gonna show you how to do this

02:15.150 --> 02:18.060
how to use Better Cap, and how to write this script yourself

02:18.060 --> 02:19.290
as we go through the course.

02:19.290 --> 02:21.660
So this is just a teaser for you to enjoy.

02:21.660 --> 02:23.793
Do not worry about the technicalities.

02:24.871 --> 02:26.760
So I'm gonna simply run it and now Better Cap

02:26.760 --> 02:29.370
is gonna intercept all the data that will be sent

02:29.370 --> 02:31.470
and received from this computer.

02:31.470 --> 02:34.110
And the last step, I'm gonna run a caplet that is

02:34.110 --> 02:36.870
called HSTS, hijack caplet.

02:36.870 --> 02:39.990
This script will allow us to downgrade connections

02:39.990 --> 02:44.610
and inject Beef's code into the browser.

02:44.610 --> 02:46.560
Again, I'm gonna show you how to write that script

02:46.560 --> 02:48.270
and use it later on in the course.

02:48.270 --> 02:50.283
So just watch it and enjoy.

02:51.322 --> 02:53.010
So I'm simply gonna hit enter to run that.

02:53.010 --> 02:54.570
And as you can see, we get no errors,

02:54.570 --> 02:57.750
meaning that everything is running successfully.

02:57.750 --> 02:59.970
And I'm also, in here, if you look

02:59.970 --> 03:02.460
at the top part of my terminal window,

03:02.460 --> 03:05.100
I'm actually listening for incoming connections

03:05.100 --> 03:08.070
because eventually the end goal is I wanna be

03:08.070 --> 03:11.130
able to receive a connection from the target computer,

03:11.130 --> 03:14.220
from my backdoor so that I can control their computer

03:14.220 --> 03:16.050
and do anything I want on it.

03:16.050 --> 03:18.360
So right now I'm listening for incoming connections.

03:18.360 --> 03:20.190
So when my attack is successful,

03:20.190 --> 03:22.053
I will get a connection in here.

03:23.430 --> 03:24.540
So let's go ahead

03:24.540 --> 03:27.240
to the target computer and simply run the browser.

03:27.240 --> 03:30.210
So we're assuming that this is the normal target user.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.280
They run their browser and for example

03:32.280 --> 03:34.320
they go to Google.ie.

03:34.320 --> 03:36.090
In order to just browse the internet

03:36.090 --> 03:39.300
or search for something that is interesting to them.

03:39.300 --> 03:40.800
Now, when this happens

03:40.800 --> 03:42.910
Better Cap is gonna automatically

03:43.932 --> 03:45.540
inject the hook code for Beef.

03:45.540 --> 03:47.370
And if we go to Beef,

03:47.370 --> 03:50.520
you can see that now we have a new online browser.

03:50.520 --> 03:54.450
So right now beef is connected to this browser right here.

03:54.450 --> 03:56.700
This browser is hooked to Beef

03:56.700 --> 03:59.430
and therefore we can click on it,

03:59.430 --> 04:02.010
get detailed information about it,

04:02.010 --> 04:04.260
and if we click on the commands,

04:04.260 --> 04:06.630
we'll be able to run a large number

04:06.630 --> 04:11.310
of commands that'll allow us to do so much on that target.

04:11.310 --> 04:14.813
Now we will go through all of that later on in the course,

04:14.813 --> 04:16.140
but the one that I wanna show you right now

04:16.140 --> 04:18.480
is in the social engineering category.

04:18.480 --> 04:22.200
It basically shows a fake notification bar

04:22.200 --> 04:24.030
for Chrome browsers.

04:24.030 --> 04:26.100
So we're gonna display a message

04:26.100 --> 04:28.860
saying critical update,

04:28.860 --> 04:31.210
click here to install

04:33.147 --> 04:37.020
and then we're gonna give a link to my backdoor.

04:37.020 --> 04:38.940
So when the user clicks on that message,

04:38.940 --> 04:40.920
they will install a backdoor.

04:40.920 --> 04:42.960
Now, I've already created that backdoor

04:42.960 --> 04:45.570
and hosted it on the web server of Cali.

04:45.570 --> 04:47.820
Again, I will show you how to use that web server

04:47.820 --> 04:49.800
and I'll show you how to create backdoors

04:49.800 --> 04:51.210
later on in the course.

04:51.210 --> 04:53.220
So for now, we're just executing

04:53.220 --> 04:54.270
and running information

04:54.270 --> 04:56.703
that we already know just as a teaser.

04:57.660 --> 05:01.320
So I'm gonna hit execute and let's go to the target browser.

05:01.320 --> 05:04.020
And as you can see, we're getting a notification bar

05:04.020 --> 05:07.050
in here telling us that there is a critical update.

05:07.050 --> 05:08.400
Click here to install.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.750
Now you could say that there's an update

05:09.750 --> 05:10.770
for Chrome or whatever.

05:10.770 --> 05:12.870
You can make this message more convincing.

05:14.198 --> 05:15.900
So if you click on install,

05:15.900 --> 05:17.100
you'll see that the file

05:17.934 --> 05:18.900
will get downloaded into my downloads

05:18.900 --> 05:20.820
just like any other file.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.500
And if I go to the downloads

05:22.500 --> 05:24.600
let me show you what this file looks like.

05:26.520 --> 05:27.353
You will notice

05:27.353 --> 05:30.420
that the file has the right icon for the Chrome installer.

05:30.420 --> 05:33.240
So right here, I actually have a clean Chrome installer.

05:33.240 --> 05:35.190
As you can see, I'm naming it clean.

05:35.190 --> 05:38.520
And this is the one that actually contains a backdoor.

05:38.520 --> 05:41.040
So you can see the files look identical,

05:41.040 --> 05:43.690
but if I run the updates that we just downloaded

05:45.240 --> 05:46.726
you will notice

05:46.726 --> 05:49.320
that you get this warning for running an executable.

05:49.320 --> 05:52.230
So we're gonna run it for an unknown publisher.

05:52.230 --> 05:54.150
And then it's actually gonna let you

05:54.150 --> 05:55.920
install Chrome as you can see.

05:55.920 --> 05:58.410
So it's Google update setup.

05:58.410 --> 06:00.009
If you say yes,

06:00.009 --> 06:02.609
you'll actually get the normal installer for Chrome.

06:04.318 --> 06:06.810
But if we go to the hacker machine in here and look

06:06.810 --> 06:10.020
at where I was listening for incoming and connections,

06:10.020 --> 06:12.540
you will notice that I actually got a connection

06:12.540 --> 06:14.850
from the Target Windows machine.

06:14.850 --> 06:17.520
So now I hacked that computer

06:17.520 --> 06:20.760
and I can do anything that the normal user can do

06:20.760 --> 06:22.020
on their computer.

06:22.020 --> 06:24.120
So I can access their file system

06:24.120 --> 06:25.950
I can register every key strike

06:25.950 --> 06:27.510
they type on their keyboard.

06:27.510 --> 06:30.300
I can listen to their mic, I can turn on their keyboard.

06:30.300 --> 06:31.950
I can turn on their camera.

06:31.950 --> 06:34.920
I can do anything that they can do on their computer.

06:34.920 --> 06:38.880
And just as a quick example to show you how severe this is,

06:38.880 --> 06:41.160
I'm gonna do webcam

06:41.160 --> 06:42.900
list to list all

06:42.900 --> 06:45.330
of the webcams connected to this computer.

06:45.330 --> 06:47.670
And as you can see, we have only one webcam.

06:47.670 --> 06:51.630
So I'm gonna do webcam stream number one,

06:51.630 --> 06:54.450
the first camera and if I hit enter,

06:54.450 --> 06:57.750
we can see a live stream of the target person.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.370
Now this is just one example

06:59.370 --> 07:02.310
of what you're gonna learn in this course, and like I said,

07:02.310 --> 07:04.410
don't worry about the technical aspects.

07:04.410 --> 07:05.670
I've connected a number

07:05.670 --> 07:07.830
of attacks here in order to achieve this.

07:07.830 --> 07:11.160
But we're gonna focus and cover every single piece

07:11.160 --> 07:13.590
of the puzzle that allowed us to do this.

07:13.590 --> 07:15.000
So don't worry about it at all.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.700
This is just a teaser to show you what you're gonna

07:17.700 --> 07:20.313
be able to do by the end of the course.
