00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
<v ->So far, we learned a number of techniques</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.500
that hackers can use to gain access to networks,

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.723
even if they use WPA and WPA2.

4
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:11.690
If this happens,

5
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.020
and a hacker manages to gain access

6
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.550
to your computer, it's game over.

7
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.270
They'll be able to run so much more powerful attacks

8
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.430
to spy on every single connected device

9
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.430
and potentially even gain full control over these devices.

10
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.110
We will be covering all of

11
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.630
that in the next section of this course,

12
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.690
but before we get into that section,

13
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.550
I want to spend one more lecture

14
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.990
showing you how to implement the security settings

15
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.570
that I recommended in the previous lecture,

16
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.680
to stop hackers from gaining access to your network,

17
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.100
and being able to do all of the attacks

18
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.100
that I'm gonna show you in the next section.

19
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.760
So, to implement the changes

20
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.200
that we discussed in the previous lecture,

21
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.930
we will have to first access the router's settings page.

22
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.620
And to do that, you're gonna first need to go

23
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.040
to your terminal,

24
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.863
and we're gonna run the IP route command.

25
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.620
This is a very simple command

26
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.740
that will simply show us the default gateways

27
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.160
in our current network.

28
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.010
So as you can see, the first default gateway is

29
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.550
10, zero, two, one; this is the one for ETH zero,

30
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.460
and the default gateway is basically the router,

31
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.520
because as we know, the router is used

32
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.010
as the default gateway to the internet.

33
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.970
So this is the default gateway

34
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.030
for the virtual NAT network

35
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.940
that this machine is configured to connect to.

36
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.820
And below it, we can see the default gateway

37
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.080
for the real wifi network

38
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.730
that lan zero is connected to.

39
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:44.563
It's saying

40
00:01:44.563 --> 00:01:46.660
that the default gateway for lan zero

41
00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.930
is this specific IP address.

42
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.450
Now for you to see this, obviously lan zero

43
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.750
needs to be connected to your wireless network.

44
00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.070
So if I look here on my networks on the wifi

45
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.950
and select network, you'll see

46
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.440
that I'm actually connected to this network,

47
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.790
which is my current wifi network.

48
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.750
Now, if you're being deauthenticated

49
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.900
and you're not able to connect to your own network

50
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.460
using wifi, then you can connect to your network

51
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.810
using an ethernet cable,

52
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.680
that way, the deauthentication attack

53
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.270
will not work against you,

54
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.630
and you'll still be able to see

55
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.400
the default gateway IP in here,

56
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.790
and use it to access the router settings

57
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.100
and modify them to improve your security.

58
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.720
Once you see the default gateway,

59
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.230
this is the IP of your router,

60
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.250
and this is the IP

61
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.943
that we're gonna use to access the

62
00:02:39.943 --> 00:02:44.090
routers settings page to modify its settings.

63
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.610
So I'm gonna copy this,

64
00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.810
and I'm gonna go to my web browser,

65
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.310
and we're simply gonna put it in the address bar,

66
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.543
and navigate to it.

67
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.610
It's gonna ask you for a username

68
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.100
and a password.

69
00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.030
Now, in many cases, you'll find this written

70
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.890
under the router

71
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.090
or at the back of the router on a sticker.

72
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.380
If you can't find it there, then look at the manual

73
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.080
for the default password.

74
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.160
A lot of the time it's admin,

75
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.100
or it could be the actual network key,

76
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.900
the default network key.

77
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.030
So I already have my password copied in my clipboard,

78
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.650
and I'm just gonna paste it here

79
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:19.623
and login.

80
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:22.323
And as you can see,

81
00:03:22.323 --> 00:03:25.280
we have access now to the router settings page

82
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.390
and this control panel;

83
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.060
you can modify any setting

84
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.200
that is related to the router.

85
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.033
Keep in mind

86
00:03:31.033 --> 00:03:33.230
that your control panel might look different.

87
00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.080
This control panel looks different dependent on the router

88
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.040
that you have,

89
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.290
but the settings

90
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.290
that we want to modify are the same.

91
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.850
So you're just gonna have to look through it

92
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.220
through the different tabs

93
00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.170
or the different layout

94
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.350
that you have, to find the settings

95
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.040
that I'm gonna modify.

96
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.310
Now, as you know, the main thing

97
00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.650
that we want to modify is the wifi, the wifi settings.

98
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.030
So in my case, I have it in here under this cog

99
00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.930
on the right, in your case, it might be in a different tab,

100
00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.020
or in a different window,

101
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.560
or in a dropdown menu.

102
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.430
You just want to make sure you find the wifi settings.

103
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.653
So I'm just gonna click on it in here.

104
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.600
So in the basic settings in here, you can see,

105
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.810
you have the different bands

106
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.890
that the router is running on.

107
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.040
That's okay.

108
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.670
You can see we have the network name so you can modify it

109
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:19.670
from here.

110
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:20.503
You can see

111
00:04:20.503 --> 00:04:22.330
that it is set to visible,

112
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.380
so you can untick this box to make the network invisible

113
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.120
so it doesn't broadcast its name.

114
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.953
The main thing

115
00:04:28.953 --> 00:04:31.460
that we want to modify in here is the security,

116
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.000
and you can see in my case, it's already set to

117
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.040
WPA2 personal.

118
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.430
So make sure you're using WPA2

119
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.120
for maximum security,

120
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.220
and you want to make sure,

121
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.100
as mentioned in the previous lecture,

122
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.270
that you use a long password

123
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.590
that is made of small

124
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.890
and capital letters, special characters

125
00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:49.860
and numbers,

126
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.740
and make it at least 14 characters.

127
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.840
That way it's very difficult to crack.

128
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.210
Once you're done with your settings,

129
00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.660
you can click on apply to apply the settings,

130
00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.630
but in my case, I haven't changed anything

131
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:02.603
so that's fine.

132
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.560
The next thing we want to do, as you remember,

133
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.700
we were able to crack networks

134
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.450
regardless of what key they used,

135
00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.240
even if the key was complex,

136
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.210
if WPS pin authentication was enabled.

137
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.460
So you're gonna need to find where your WPS settings are.

138
00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.820
In my case, it's in here in a different tab,

139
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.270
we're gonna click on it,

140
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.210
and we're gonna make sure

141
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.840
that it is disabled.

142
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.673
So,

143
00:05:26.673 --> 00:05:29.680
and here, as you can see, WPS is on in my case.

144
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.670
So I'm gonna click on it, one click, to disable it.

145
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.910
And we're gonna click on apply to apply the changes.

146
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.780
In some routers, this will disable it for both bonds,

147
00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.850
in my case, I need to manually also go to the settings

148
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.550
of the five gigahertz by clicking in here,

149
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.120
and disable it manually for that.

150
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.740
I got disconnected for a bit of time,

151
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.580
because when you change settings within the router,

152
00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:53.920
it will need to restart.

153
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.160
So you need to give it some time

154
00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.410
once you click on apply

155
00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:00.600
or save for the router to restart with the new settings.

156
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.350
We're gonna refresh now, just to see if we have it back.

157
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.070
As you can see, we still don't have it back

158
00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.313
so we need to give it a bit of time.

159
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.440
Okay, so I'm being asked to log in again

160
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.173
because the router restarted.

161
00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.003
And we're gonna go back to the wifi settings, WPS.

162
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.160
And as you can see, it's off now.

163
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.633
So we also want to go to the five gigahertz,

164
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.720
and we want to make sure it's off as well.

165
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.880
You might not have to do this on your router,

166
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.820
but in my case, I have to do it manually

167
00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:33.930
for the five gigahertz.

168
00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.360
and for the two point four gigahertz.

169
00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.193
Another feature

170
00:06:37.193 --> 00:06:40.330
that you might find useful is the MAC filtering

171
00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:41.540
or access control.

172
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.120
You might find this under different names.

173
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.750
This allows us to define a list of MAC addresses

174
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.200
that can connect

175
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.200
or should be disconnected from the network.

176
00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.130
So from here, you can select to create an allow

177
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:56.740
or a deny list.

178
00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.750
So if we go on the allow list,

179
00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.280
we're gonna be specifying the MAC addresses

180
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.250
that are allowed to connect to the network.

181
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:05.420
All you have to do is simply

182
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.380
put the MAC address here, add it

183
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:08.350
and save it,

184
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:11.910
and then only these specified MAC addresses will be allowed

185
00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:13.473
to connect to the network.

186
00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:15.620
So that's pretty much it.

187
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:16.550
You just want to make sure

188
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.440
that you're using WPA2, disable WPS,

189
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.700
and use a long password made up of small letters,

190
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.520
capital letters, numbers,

191
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.410
and special characters.

192
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.680
You can also use the access control

193
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.930
or MAC filtering to prevent

194
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.690
or allow certain MAC addresses.

195
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:38.690
Also, keep in mind if you were being deauthenticated

196
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:39.680
from your own network,

197
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.880
so if you're not able to connect to your own network

198
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.360
using the wifi settings in here through wifi,

199
00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.810
then you can connect to the router using an ethernet cable,

200
00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:53.090
and that's why the deauthentication attack

201
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:54.730
will not work against you.

202
00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:56.540
Then you'll be able to come in here,

203
00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:00.220
modify the network settings to prevent the attacker

204
00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:03.030
from launching attacks against you,

205
00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:05.417
without being deauthenticated.
