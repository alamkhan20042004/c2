00:01.110 --> 00:03.180
Lecturer: Okay, now that we had a quick overview

00:03.180 --> 00:04.890
of Kali Linux I want

00:04.890 --> 00:08.190
to spend some time talking about the Linux terminal.

00:08.190 --> 00:09.930
So, you can access the terminal

00:09.930 --> 00:12.120
through this application right here.

00:12.120 --> 00:12.953
So if you click on

00:12.953 --> 00:16.140
that, it'll open the terminal window for us.

00:16.140 --> 00:19.170
And as you can see all it is is a black screen

00:19.170 --> 00:20.763
where you can type commands.

00:21.990 --> 00:25.590
Now, the Linux terminal is actually very, very powerful

00:25.590 --> 00:28.110
because it can be used to do anything

00:28.110 --> 00:30.210
that you can think of, really.

00:30.210 --> 00:32.340
A lot of the applications in Linux

00:32.340 --> 00:34.560
that have a graphical interface

00:34.560 --> 00:36.990
were command prompt programs first

00:36.990 --> 00:40.590
and then people made a graphical interface for it.

00:40.590 --> 00:43.140
So a lot of the time maybe the graphical interface

00:43.140 --> 00:44.760
will be buggy or crash

00:44.760 --> 00:47.283
and the terminal program will still work.

00:48.300 --> 00:51.120
Also, a lot of the penetration testing tools

00:51.120 --> 00:53.880
do not even have a graphical interface.

00:53.880 --> 00:57.393
A lot of them can only be used throughout the terminal.

00:58.320 --> 00:59.580
Not only that, but

00:59.580 --> 01:03.360
in many scenarios you might only have an SSH

01:03.360 --> 01:06.330
or a command prompt access to a machine.

01:06.330 --> 01:09.450
So you need to know how to use this command prompt

01:09.450 --> 01:12.180
in order to achieve your goals.

01:12.180 --> 01:13.440
So throughout the course,

01:13.440 --> 01:15.870
we're gonna be using the terminal a lot

01:15.870 --> 01:17.130
and that's why I want

01:17.130 --> 01:20.850
to spend some time just showing you the basics of it

01:20.850 --> 01:24.093
and making sure that you're gonna be comfortable using it.

01:25.230 --> 01:28.200
Now, the basic idea is you type a command

01:28.200 --> 01:31.920
and the result will be displayed for you on screen.

01:31.920 --> 01:32.970
So, let's have a look

01:32.970 --> 01:36.603
on a very, very simple command which is pwd.

01:37.650 --> 01:40.920
Now this command prints the current working directory,

01:40.920 --> 01:43.560
hence the name pwd.

01:43.560 --> 01:48.000
So if I head enter, you can see it's printing /root

01:48.000 --> 01:51.990
which means right now I am in the root directory.

01:51.990 --> 01:56.223
So basically, I am in here. This is the root, it's home.

01:57.480 --> 01:59.790
So if I do ls, which is a command

01:59.790 --> 02:02.580
to list all the directories and files

02:02.580 --> 02:05.910
in the current working directory, we should get all

02:05.910 --> 02:08.133
of these directories that we see in here.

02:09.420 --> 02:11.070
So if I hit Enter,

02:11.070 --> 02:14.250
as you can see I can see all these directories

02:14.250 --> 02:16.023
in the current working directory.

02:17.040 --> 02:20.730
Now, another very useful command is the cd command.

02:20.730 --> 02:25.560
This command allow us to navigate into another directory.

02:25.560 --> 02:28.260
So for example, let's say I want to navigate

02:28.260 --> 02:30.390
into the downloads.

02:30.390 --> 02:34.260
All we have to do is type cd, followed by the name

02:34.260 --> 02:37.590
of the directory that I want to navigate to.

02:37.590 --> 02:39.363
So I'm gonna type downloads.

02:40.980 --> 02:45.660
Now, if I hit Enter, I should be inside the downloads now.

02:45.660 --> 02:49.500
So if I do pwd to see my current working directory,

02:49.500 --> 02:54.360
you'll see that it's saying I'm in root/downloads.

02:54.360 --> 02:57.870
So if I do ls here, it should show me all the directories

02:57.870 --> 03:00.330
and files inside downloads.

03:00.330 --> 03:04.140
So if I do enter, as you can see I have a directory

03:04.140 --> 03:05.760
and a file in here.

03:05.760 --> 03:08.280
And these are the exact same files that you'll see

03:08.280 --> 03:10.353
if you double click the downloads here.

03:12.540 --> 03:15.360
Now, if you want to go back one directory

03:15.360 --> 03:19.252
so similar to pressing the back button in here, all you have

03:19.252 --> 03:21.690
to do is do cd, again, the command

03:21.690 --> 03:25.383
to change the working directory followed by dot dot.

03:26.520 --> 03:30.630
And now if I do pwd, you'll see I'm back in root.

03:30.630 --> 03:33.420
And if I do ls, you'll see all the directories

03:33.420 --> 03:34.683
and files in root.

03:35.850 --> 03:39.960
So that's all good and there's actually a huge number

03:39.960 --> 03:41.790
of commands that you can use.

03:41.790 --> 03:44.070
So I'm going to include a link

03:44.070 --> 03:46.050
in the resources of this lecture

03:46.050 --> 03:48.870
of all the Linux commands that you can use.

03:48.870 --> 03:50.670
You don't need to know them by heart.

03:50.670 --> 03:52.080
We're actually gonna be using a lot

03:52.080 --> 03:53.430
of them throughout the course.

03:53.430 --> 03:56.160
So you're going to naturally learn them

03:56.160 --> 03:57.693
as you go through the course.

03:58.830 --> 04:00.660
Now, if you are using a command

04:00.660 --> 04:03.510
and you're not sure about how this command works,

04:03.510 --> 04:05.940
you can just use the man command

04:05.940 --> 04:09.450
to display the manual of this command.

04:09.450 --> 04:11.790
For example, we've used the ls command here

04:11.790 --> 04:12.720
to list the files

04:12.720 --> 04:15.600
and directories in the current working directory.

04:15.600 --> 04:19.380
But if I do man followed by ls,

04:19.380 --> 04:23.310
this basically means I'm requesting the manual of ls.

04:23.310 --> 04:26.043
So I'm asking how can I use the ls command?

04:26.940 --> 04:30.870
So if I hit Enter you'll see I'll get a screen similar

04:30.870 --> 04:32.460
to a text file.

04:32.460 --> 04:34.650
And basically it's giving me a lot

04:34.650 --> 04:38.610
of information on how to use the ls command.

04:38.610 --> 04:40.470
So you can see that it's telling us

04:40.470 --> 04:43.800
that this command will list the directory contents.

04:43.800 --> 04:46.560
You can see the way it works by typing ls followed

04:46.560 --> 04:48.600
by the options, followed by a file

04:48.600 --> 04:51.930
if you want to run it on a file.

04:51.930 --> 04:55.870
You can see a longer description of the command

04:56.734 --> 04:59.850
and then you can see all the options

04:59.850 --> 05:03.483
and the arguments that we can use with this command.

05:04.680 --> 05:06.450
Now in Linux, most

05:06.450 --> 05:10.290
of the time, the options will always follow the same syntax.

05:10.290 --> 05:12.690
So you either use dash letter

05:12.690 --> 05:16.890
or dash dash a word to specify the argument.

05:16.890 --> 05:19.080
For example, in here, the -a

05:19.080 --> 05:23.793
and --all will ignore entries starting with dot.

05:24.930 --> 05:28.890
So if you keep going down in here you'll see all the options

05:28.890 --> 05:32.103
and arguments you can use with the ls command.

05:33.120 --> 05:35.370
And we have another example here.

05:35.370 --> 05:38.400
We have the -l which means it's going

05:38.400 --> 05:40.890
to use a long listing format

05:40.890 --> 05:43.850
which will display more information about the files

05:43.850 --> 05:45.663
in the current working directory.

05:46.650 --> 05:47.850
So let's have a look on that.

05:47.850 --> 05:50.670
I'm gonna press Q to exit this

05:50.670 --> 05:53.280
and then we're gonna do ls as usual.

05:53.280 --> 05:57.060
And since we read the manual, we know we can do -l

05:57.060 --> 05:59.940
to see more information about the files.

05:59.940 --> 06:01.590
And if I hit enter now,

06:01.590 --> 06:04.470
you can see I'm still getting the same directories

06:04.470 --> 06:07.590
but it's also showing me the permissions, the users,

06:07.590 --> 06:09.933
the date created and so on.

06:10.950 --> 06:12.810
So you can use the man command

06:12.810 --> 06:16.357
on any command you want, not only on the ls.

06:16.357 --> 06:20.430
So you can use it on the pwd, you can use it on the cd

06:20.430 --> 06:24.210
or any other command, and it'll show you full description

06:24.210 --> 06:28.113
or the manual page of how to use this command.

06:29.790 --> 06:33.160
Now, I'm going to clear the screen by typing clear

06:34.650 --> 06:38.580
and the next thing that I wanna show you is the --help.

06:38.580 --> 06:41.370
So, this is something that you can use again

06:41.370 --> 06:44.850
in almost all commands in all programs in Linux.

06:44.850 --> 06:46.980
So you can just type the program name

06:46.980 --> 06:50.793
or the command name followed by --help.

06:52.320 --> 06:56.190
As you might think, this will show you help message telling

06:56.190 --> 06:57.630
you what this command is

06:57.630 --> 07:01.110
or what this program is, the arguments that it takes, how

07:01.110 --> 07:04.923
to use these arguments and examples at the bottom.

07:06.060 --> 07:08.070
Now, another useful thing with the terminal

07:08.070 --> 07:11.010
so I'm gonna clear this again, is the arrows.

07:11.010 --> 07:14.430
So you can press up to go up to see all the commands

07:14.430 --> 07:16.170
that we executed before.

07:16.170 --> 07:18.150
And again, you can go down to navigate

07:18.150 --> 07:21.783
between the commands that you executed previously.

07:22.830 --> 07:26.400
You can also use the tab for auto complete.

07:26.400 --> 07:29.730
So again, let's do ls. And you can see all the files.

07:29.730 --> 07:33.180
And let's say we want to go into documents.

07:33.180 --> 07:36.330
So we can do cd followed by documents.

07:36.330 --> 07:38.886
You can type documents, or if you're lazy

07:38.886 --> 07:43.886
like me you can just do DOC and press Tab.

07:43.920 --> 07:47.580
And as you can see, it's automatically completing the rest

07:47.580 --> 07:48.813
of the word for me.

07:49.680 --> 07:51.480
So this is something that comes very,

07:51.480 --> 07:54.993
very handy when you're using the terminal for a long time.

07:56.100 --> 07:59.940
Now, what I also wanna show you is how to install programs

07:59.940 --> 08:02.310
in Kali from the terminal.

08:02.310 --> 08:05.100
So first I'm gonna clear this, and the first thing

08:05.100 --> 08:07.650
that you wanna do is update the sources

08:07.650 --> 08:11.313
where Kali can search and download programs from.

08:12.360 --> 08:15.873
So we're gonna do apt-get update.

08:16.890 --> 08:20.400
Now, app get is the name of the application that allow us

08:20.400 --> 08:22.920
to download and install programs.

08:22.920 --> 08:25.410
And we're saying update because I'm saying

08:25.410 --> 08:27.720
that I want you to update the list

08:27.720 --> 08:30.900
of all the programs that I can install.

08:30.900 --> 08:33.390
So I'm gonna hit Enter, and you wanna make sure

08:33.390 --> 08:36.600
that you have internet connection when running this.

08:36.600 --> 08:39.330
And as you can see, it's telling me that it's done.

08:39.330 --> 08:44.310
And now we can go ahead and start installing applications.

08:44.310 --> 08:47.940
So the first program that I wanna install is actually

08:47.940 --> 08:50.790
a terminal program, so similar to this one

08:50.790 --> 08:55.260
but it allow us to have multiple terminal windows open

08:55.260 --> 08:56.463
in the same window.

08:57.360 --> 08:59.700
So, in order to install a program

08:59.700 --> 09:02.880
through the command line we're gonna do apt-get,

09:02.880 --> 09:05.400
which is again the name of the program that allow us

09:05.400 --> 09:08.760
to install programs on the system.

09:08.760 --> 09:11.940
We're gonna say that I want to install

09:11.940 --> 09:15.903
and the program that I want to install is called Terminator.

09:17.670 --> 09:19.380
So very, very simple.

09:19.380 --> 09:20.820
First of all we're typing the name

09:20.820 --> 09:23.250
of the command, which is apt-get.

09:23.250 --> 09:26.580
We're saying that I want to install, and the program name

09:26.580 --> 09:30.000
that I wanna install is called Terminator.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.500
So I'm gonna hit Enter and this is going to download

09:34.500 --> 09:37.380
and install Terminator for me.

09:37.380 --> 09:38.880
So you can use the same command

09:38.880 --> 09:41.130
to install any program that you want.

09:41.130 --> 09:43.830
You just need to replace Terminator with the name

09:43.830 --> 09:46.353
of the program that you want to install.

09:47.370 --> 09:50.460
Now, I've already downloaded and installed this before

09:50.460 --> 09:52.980
so it didn't ask me to confirm.

09:52.980 --> 09:54.150
But, if you're running this

09:54.150 --> 09:57.660
for the first time, it might ask you to confirm whether

09:57.660 --> 10:00.480
or not you actually want to install this program.

10:00.480 --> 10:02.340
So all you'd have to do is press Y

10:02.340 --> 10:05.310
from the keyboard and hit Enter.

10:05.310 --> 10:07.320
Now, as you can see, it's done.

10:07.320 --> 10:10.570
So if I go to my all applications in here

10:12.030 --> 10:17.030
and just type Terminator, you can see that I have it here.

10:17.220 --> 10:19.500
So I'm actually gonna drag it and put it

10:19.500 --> 10:24.003
in my doc so I can access it easily in the future.

10:25.830 --> 10:28.590
So now I can just click it in here

10:28.590 --> 10:31.590
and that'll open Terminator for me.

10:31.590 --> 10:34.080
Now, this is another application that allow me

10:34.080 --> 10:38.070
to run commands, so it's exactly the same as this.

10:38.070 --> 10:41.580
So again, I can do ls and pwd.

10:41.580 --> 10:43.170
The only difference is

10:43.170 --> 10:45.960
with this one, I can actually right click

10:45.960 --> 10:48.873
and click on split horizontally, for example.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.810
And this will split the same screen

10:51.810 --> 10:56.070
into two screens where I can run commands at the same time.

10:56.070 --> 10:58.350
So I can have some commands in here

10:58.350 --> 11:00.273
and I can run commands in here.

11:01.470 --> 11:03.600
And then I can even split this more

11:03.600 --> 11:07.590
if I want, again, vertically or horizontally.

11:07.590 --> 11:10.950
And as you can see, I can have as many terminal windows

11:10.950 --> 11:13.440
as I want, and this will be very helpful

11:13.440 --> 11:15.990
in the future when we'll be running a number

11:15.990 --> 11:19.383
of programs and a number of commands at the same time.

11:20.790 --> 11:22.740
Now, before I let you go, I just want

11:22.740 --> 11:25.470
to show you two websites that I'm gonna include

11:25.470 --> 11:27.990
in the resources of this lecture.

11:27.990 --> 11:30.030
First of all, we have a website here

11:30.030 --> 11:33.900
that includes the most common Linux commands, if not all.

11:33.900 --> 11:36.570
So you can go through them and familiarize yourself

11:36.570 --> 11:38.940
with them, but keep in mind, you don't need

11:38.940 --> 11:40.590
to know them all by heart.

11:40.590 --> 11:43.650
Like I said, as you go through my course,

11:43.650 --> 11:44.910
and as you continue on

11:44.910 --> 11:47.130
with your journey you will learn the commands

11:47.130 --> 11:49.023
that you need as you go.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.080
Another really useful resource

11:52.080 --> 11:55.830
that I'm gonna include is explainshell.com.

11:55.830 --> 11:59.550
This website is designed to explain Linux commands to you.

11:59.550 --> 12:02.100
So all you have to do is type the commands in here.

12:02.100 --> 12:07.100
So for example, if you just type ls and hit Explain.

12:08.130 --> 12:11.610
It'll explain that ls will list directory content.

12:11.610 --> 12:15.510
You could make it more complex and do ls-la.

12:15.510 --> 12:18.960
And if we hit enter now, it'll break all the arguments

12:18.960 --> 12:21.420
and explain every single argument.

12:21.420 --> 12:25.110
So again, ls, this contents, if we highlight the L

12:25.110 --> 12:27.840
as you can see, it's telling us that it's going

12:27.840 --> 12:30.990
to use a long listing format, as we've seen earlier.

12:30.990 --> 12:33.570
And the A at the end is the same

12:33.570 --> 12:36.240
as -a, which is all which means

12:36.240 --> 12:39.840
that we do not want to ignore entries starting with a dot.

12:39.840 --> 12:42.213
So we do not want to ignore hidden files.

12:43.140 --> 12:44.940
So you can do any command in here.

12:44.940 --> 12:47.940
You can do apt-get install, for example

12:47.940 --> 12:49.980
and it'll actually explain it to you.

12:49.980 --> 12:52.200
So it'll explain apt is a package manager.

12:52.200 --> 12:55.910
Install can be used to install packages and so on.

12:55.910 --> 12:57.570
So if you ever see a Linux command

12:57.570 --> 12:59.730
that you don't understand, you can always just come

12:59.730 --> 13:02.760
in here, put the command and it'll break it down to you

13:02.760 --> 13:05.013
and explain it really nicely.
