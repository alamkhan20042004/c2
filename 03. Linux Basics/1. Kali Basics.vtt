WEBVTT

00:00.300 --> 00:02.610
Instructor: Now that we have Kali Linux installed,

00:02.610 --> 00:04.950
I want to give you a basic overview

00:04.950 --> 00:07.530
of this operating system in this lecture

00:07.530 --> 00:09.300
so that you're comfortable with it.

00:09.300 --> 00:12.000
And we're gonna be using it throughout the whole course.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.700
So everything is gonna become easier for you

00:14.700 --> 00:16.173
as we go through the course.

00:17.370 --> 00:19.110
Now, the first thing that I want to talk about

00:19.110 --> 00:21.360
is the status bar in here.

00:21.360 --> 00:24.990
So you can see we have an applications menu in here,

00:24.990 --> 00:27.060
and inside it you can see

00:27.060 --> 00:29.433
all the applications are categorized.

00:30.270 --> 00:33.090
So we have information gathering applications,

00:33.090 --> 00:36.780
vulnerability analysis, web application analysis,

00:36.780 --> 00:40.170
reverse engineering, and so on.

00:40.170 --> 00:42.720
So you can go on each one of these entries

00:42.720 --> 00:45.273
and just select any program that you want to run.

00:46.320 --> 00:49.170
And the next menu that we have is the Places,

00:49.170 --> 00:53.250
which shows you the most common Places in the file system.

00:53.250 --> 00:56.583
So we have Home, we have the Documents, Downloads and so on.

00:57.570 --> 00:59.520
So you can access the places from here,

00:59.520 --> 01:01.380
and then you click on Home,

01:01.380 --> 01:05.010
or you can just click on the files icon in here on the left.

01:05.010 --> 01:08.160
And both of these will bring you to the Home directory,

01:08.160 --> 01:10.980
which is actually the root directory.

01:10.980 --> 01:13.350
So it says Home in here,

01:13.350 --> 01:17.190
but the actual location of this, if I do Control + L,

01:17.190 --> 01:19.923
you'll see it is /root.

01:20.970 --> 01:23.610
So inside this you can see we have our Downloads,

01:23.610 --> 01:25.830
Music, Pictures, similar to the way

01:25.830 --> 01:28.353
that you'd have it in Windows and OSX.

01:29.430 --> 01:31.530
We also have the timing here.

01:31.530 --> 01:34.740
And in here on the right, we have more controls.

01:34.740 --> 01:38.610
So the first thing that we have in here is the workspaces.

01:38.610 --> 01:42.780
So Linux comes with multiple workspaces by default.

01:42.780 --> 01:44.760
Basically what this allow us to do

01:44.760 --> 01:47.550
is we can have this desktop in here, for example,

01:47.550 --> 01:50.970
we can open the Places and we can, for example,

01:50.970 --> 01:53.583
navigate to Downloads and do some work in here.

01:54.450 --> 01:59.450
But if we go here to workplaces and go to the second one,

02:00.120 --> 02:02.130
you can see that I have an empty desktop,

02:02.130 --> 02:03.930
that I can do whatever I want.

02:03.930 --> 02:06.483
And for example, I can launch Firefox in here.

02:08.250 --> 02:11.700
And then again, if I want to go back to the first workspace,

02:11.700 --> 02:14.760
click on number one, and I'm back in here.

02:14.760 --> 02:17.610
And because I've already used up two spaces,

02:17.610 --> 02:21.030
the system is already creating a third empty space.

02:21.030 --> 02:23.370
So I can click on that and as you can see,

02:23.370 --> 02:26.223
I'm in the third space where I can do more stuff.

02:27.330 --> 02:31.140
The next part of the status bar is this last part in here.

02:31.140 --> 02:32.520
And if you click on it,

02:32.520 --> 02:34.560
basically the first thing it'll allow you to do

02:34.560 --> 02:36.510
is control the sound.

02:36.510 --> 02:39.150
Next, you'll see your connections.

02:39.150 --> 02:42.000
So as you can see right now, and as I showed you before,

02:42.000 --> 02:45.570
this is showing up as if we're connected to a wired network

02:45.570 --> 02:47.610
because I configured this network

02:47.610 --> 02:49.233
to use an ng network.

02:50.220 --> 02:53.610
If you have a wireless adapter connected to this computer,

02:53.610 --> 02:55.830
you should be able to see it here.

02:55.830 --> 02:58.470
If you don't see it, then follow the link

02:58.470 --> 03:00.360
in the resources of this lecture

03:00.360 --> 03:03.720
to see how to properly connect your wireless adapter

03:03.720 --> 03:07.173
or any USB device to a virtual machine.

03:08.070 --> 03:12.900
Now, I should note, you can only use external USB adapters

03:12.900 --> 03:16.440
in order to access wifi networks from Kali.

03:16.440 --> 03:19.143
You cannot use the built-in wifi card,

03:20.040 --> 03:22.710
but Kali should have internet connection anyway

03:22.710 --> 03:25.560
because it is configured to use an ng network.

03:25.560 --> 03:26.760
And as you can see in here,

03:26.760 --> 03:29.790
it's telling me my wired is connected.

03:29.790 --> 03:33.453
So if I actually go down to Firefox, I'll close this.

03:35.340 --> 03:38.253
And if I just go to google.com,

03:39.090 --> 03:41.643
you can see it is connected to the internet.

03:43.620 --> 03:46.023
So let's go back to where we were.

03:47.100 --> 03:49.770
And if we click here,

03:49.770 --> 03:52.920
we also have the battery settings.

03:52.920 --> 03:55.680
You have this button to turn off the machine.

03:55.680 --> 03:57.600
This is to lock the machine.

03:57.600 --> 03:59.730
And this will show the preferences

03:59.730 --> 04:02.340
where you can modify the preferences of the machine.

04:02.340 --> 04:04.530
So you have Bluetooth, wifi,

04:04.530 --> 04:07.500
change the background and so on.

04:07.500 --> 04:10.260
So you can spend some time getting familiar with this.

04:10.260 --> 04:12.900
It's very easy and very intuitive.

04:12.900 --> 04:15.990
Same goes to the file manager in here, very intuitive.

04:15.990 --> 04:17.550
Double click to go in.

04:17.550 --> 04:19.020
You can right click and archive

04:19.020 --> 04:21.540
and extract here to uncompress it.

04:21.540 --> 04:24.630
You can navigate throughout these files by clicking them.

04:24.630 --> 04:26.250
And then you have the trash here,

04:26.250 --> 04:28.890
which contains the deleted files.

04:28.890 --> 04:30.690
Now we also have the doc in here,

04:30.690 --> 04:33.540
which contains the favorite applications.

04:33.540 --> 04:36.960
And you can also access all the other applications

04:36.960 --> 04:41.070
by clicking on this icon right here, the show applications.

04:41.070 --> 04:42.780
And this will show you a menu

04:42.780 --> 04:45.000
with the most frequent applications.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.560
You can click through these arrows

04:46.560 --> 04:48.870
to load all of the applications.

04:48.870 --> 04:51.270
You can also use this search box

04:51.270 --> 04:53.460
to search through these applications.

04:53.460 --> 04:56.040
For example, if I wanted to search for

04:56.040 --> 04:58.290
this program right here, nikto,

04:58.290 --> 05:00.990
all I have to do is type "nik",

05:00.990 --> 05:04.020
and as you can see, it's filtering it for me.

05:04.020 --> 05:05.430
And last but not least,

05:05.430 --> 05:07.770
you can also switch between the desktops

05:07.770 --> 05:10.500
that I showed you in here through this menu

05:10.500 --> 05:12.753
by clicking on these desktops.

05:13.830 --> 05:15.870
And if you wanna exit out of this,

05:15.870 --> 05:18.660
you can simply press the Escape button on your keyboard

05:18.660 --> 05:22.263
or press the show apps icon in here on the left.
