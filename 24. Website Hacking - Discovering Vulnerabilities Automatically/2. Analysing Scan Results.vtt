00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.210
<v ->So the scan is over now.</v>

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.410
And you can see on the left here we have our website.

3
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.780
Clicking on it will show you some results of the spider

4
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.113
when it was looking for the files.

5
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.580
The very interesting part is the alerts here.

6
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.040
Right here you can see all the vulnerabilities

7
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.453
that have been discovered.

8
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.470
On the left here you can see that we have seven red flags.

9
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.693
So these are the high priority alerts.

10
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.100
We have three orange flags, and five yellow flags,

11
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.930
and zero blue.

12
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.213
So these are organized in the order of their severity.

13
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.430
Clicking on any of these categories will expand it

14
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.120
and show the threats that have been found related

15
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.520
to that thread.

16
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.720
For example, clicking on the path reversal

17
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.120
you'll see all the URLs that can be exploited

18
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.050
to read files from the server.

19
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.770
Clicking on any of these,

20
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.040
you'll see the HTTP request that was sent.

21
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.520
In order to discover this,

22
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.280
you'll see the response that why the tool thinks

23
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.400
that this is vulnerable.

24
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.820
And we can see that in the response,

25
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.320
the tool was able to get the contents

26
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.133
of ETC password.

27
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.130
Right here you can see the URL that the tool used

28
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.193
to exploit this vulnerability.

29
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.120
And in here, you can see a description

30
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.510
of what the current vulnerability is,

31
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.233
and how it has been exploited.

32
00:01:37.288 --> 00:01:38.880
And here you can see the risk of it.

33
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.700
So this is very high

34
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.900
you can see the confidence so how confident

35
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.930
the tool about the existence

36
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.720
of this vulnerability, you can see that it's been injected

37
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.720
into a page and the attack is trying to get ETC password.

38
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.400
So let's try and right click on this and open it in browser

39
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.050
and as you can see now it exploited it for us,

40
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.650
and it showed us the output for this vulnerability,

41
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.630
and we can read the contents of ETC password.

42
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.950
And you can see that the exploit is being exploited

43
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.563
in this URL right here.

44
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.960
Let's have a look on another example.

45
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.960
For example, a cross site scripting

46
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.490
and again, the tool also checks for post and get parameters.

47
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.240
So sometimes when the parameter,

48
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.060
when the injection is sent into text boxes,

49
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.820
or even sent without text boxes,

50
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.700
if it's sent in a post parameter,

51
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.490
you won't see it in the URL.

52
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.430
So it actually checks for post and get

53
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.960
and you can see here it found a vulnerability

54
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.400
in a POST request and the register page

55
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.250
and it also found one in a get page.

56
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.820
Again, right click and open in browser

57
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.510
will execute for us

58
00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.180
and we can see the code has been executed.

59
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.970
Again, we can have The URL of the execution right here,

60
00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.990
if you want to use it with beef or any other tools,

61
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.770
and we can see it in here as well the URL that's being used

62
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.453
to exploit this vulnerability.

63
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.823
Let's just have one more example of an SQL injection.

64
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.770
Again, click on it, it will show you why it believes

65
00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.083
that there is an SQL injection here.

66
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.130
It will show you the URL and it will show you

67
00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.400
the attack that it used.

68
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.463
It used and one equals one

69
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.550
and it's in the parameter password.

70
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.250
And if you remember we actually did exploit this parameter.

71
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.250
Open in this in the browser will show us that the injection

72
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.103
has been is working and it's username

73
00:03:52.103 --> 00:03:53.403
and a password called zap.

74
00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.190
So the tool is very simple, very powerful and very useful.

75
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.100
You can play around with it you can play around

76
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.870
with the proxy and with the options

77
00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.070
and see how you can enhance the results

78
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.143
and achieve even better results.
