00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.350
<v Instructor>So far we learnt how to manually discover</v>

2
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.450
a number of very dangerous vulnerabilities.

3
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.660
We seen how they work and how to exploit them.

4
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.809
In today's video, I'd like to show you a tool

5
00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.520
that will allow you to automatically discover

6
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.060
vulnerabilities in web applications.

7
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.140
It will allow you to discover the vulnerabilities

8
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.770
that we learned, plus much more.

9
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.550
The reason why I didn't teach you this at the start,

10
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.530
because I wanted you to learn how to do it manually,

11
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.470
and I also wanted you to know

12
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.700
how this vulnerabilities occur,

13
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.200
so to understand the reason behind them.

14
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.107
Also this are just tools,

15
00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:43.330
so this program is just a tool,

16
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.118
it can make mistakes and it can show false positives.

17
00:00:46.118 --> 00:00:49.440
It can also miss vulnerabilities in some cases.

18
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.160
Therefore, I wanted you to know

19
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.650
how to do this stuff manually,

20
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.650
so if the program doesn't work

21
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.280
or if the program misses something,

22
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.833
then you'll be able to find it.

23
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.160
The best way to use these programs is as a back up

24
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.073
or as just a tool to help you with your penetration testing.

25
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.600
So using the tool is very simple.

26
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.100
I'm gonna go on my applications

27
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.763
and then I'm gonna type in ZAP.

28
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.180
And it's asking me if I wanted to save the current session

29
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.963
when I search for something, so I'm gonna say no.

30
00:01:25.344 --> 00:01:28.980
And this is the main view of the tool,

31
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.030
so on the left here you'll see the websites

32
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.650
that you're targeting.

33
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.390
On the right, you can attack and send the website URL,

34
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.190
and in here you'll see the results for your attacking

35
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.293
or for your scan.

36
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.950
If we go here on the cog on the left,

37
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.103
it'll allow you to modify the options for the program.

38
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.370
So you can modify certain aspects of it,

39
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.460
the way the fuzzer works, the way the spider works,

40
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.743
the way the scan works.

41
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.980
I'm gonna leave everything the same.

42
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.770
Another thing that you can modify

43
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.900
is the policies used in this scan,

44
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.450
so it's something similar to these scans

45
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.330
that we we're using with andmap,

46
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.530
the intense scan and all of that.

47
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.640
So I'm gonna press on the plus,

48
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.980
I'm gonna press on the active scan,

49
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.560
and if you press on this,

50
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.603
on the left here,

51
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.350
and I'm gonna press under default policy,

52
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.960
now you can create your own policies

53
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.830
by using the add button,

54
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.390
I'm gonna press on the default one

55
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.760
and I'm gonna go on modify

56
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.163
to show you the aspects that you can modify.

57
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.890
So right here we can modify the name,

58
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.033
the threshold and the strength for the global policy.

59
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.340
Click in on each of these categories

60
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.340
will allow you to modify the specific scans

61
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.770
that will be performed.

62
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.820
For example, in the injection tab here,

63
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.990
we can see all the injection scans

64
00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.200
that the program is going to try.

65
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.580
For example, we can see SQL injections here,

66
00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.140
we can see Cross-site scripting here,

67
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.220
and pressing on the threshold right here

68
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.220
we can set this to default, low, medium or high.

69
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:12.980
Setting it to the default

70
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.560
will just default to the value selected here

71
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.933
which is medium right now,

72
00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.690
or you can have for example,

73
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.840
if SQL injection is what you're looking for,

74
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.583
if what you're looking for is access from the database,

75
00:03:24.583 --> 00:03:26.410
then you can set this to high

76
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.930
so that it'll try everything

77
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.923
and it'll try to find it in even difficult places.

78
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.050
So I'm gonna close all of this

79
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.720
I'm leaving everything the same,

80
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.520
and I'm gonna start my attack against the mutillidae script,

81
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.500
so we have it in 10.20.14.204

82
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.453
running in metasploitable machine,

83
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.870
and if we go on Mutillidae right here,

84
00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.210
that's the URL,

85
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.123
so literally I'm just gonna copy this,

86
00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.723
and paste it here,

87
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.533
And then I'm gonna attack.

88
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.320
Now the tool is first gonna try to find all the URL's

89
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.140
and then it's going to try and attack this URL's

90
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.200
based on the scan policy that we used.

91
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.430
I'm gonna pause the video

92
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.413
and resume it once the scan is over.
