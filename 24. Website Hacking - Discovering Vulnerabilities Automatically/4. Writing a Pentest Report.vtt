00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.270
<v Lecturer>Throughout the course,</v>

2
00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:04.210
we learned a number of methods to discover bugs

3
00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.330
and vulnerabilities in different types of software

4
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.460
and infrastructure.

5
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.300
Usually, at the end of the pentest,

6
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.920
you will need to inform the client

7
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.690
with all of the vulnerabilities that you found

8
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.870
or with all of the findings,

9
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.970
this is done using a pentest report.

10
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.580
So basically what we mean by a pentest report,

11
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.780
it's just a document that includes everything

12
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.160
that you found through your engagement

13
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.540
so that the client or the admin

14
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.700
can go ahead and fix all of the vulnerabilities

15
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.080
and the weaknesses that you found.

16
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.100
These reports are also read by executives a lot of the time,

17
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.500
therefore you would need to account for that,

18
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.960
so a good report should be easy enough,

19
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.810
but it's also easy to understand.

20
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.300
Now, if you're working as a pentester,

21
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.420
then the company that you're working for

22
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.150
will probably have their own template

23
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.820
and their own standards that you have to follow

24
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.290
when writing a report.

25
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.440
And in many cases,

26
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.770
you won't even be doing that,

27
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.880
you'll simply be forwarding your findings to another member

28
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:08.820
in your own team,

29
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.300
and they will be fill in the blanks properly in the report.

30
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.890
Therefore you probably will not need to write one

31
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:15.820
from scratch,

32
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.050
and in many cases, you won't even write the actual report

33
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.363
that the client sees.

34
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.460
With that being said, I still wanna show you

35
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.110
how this is done just to give you an idea

36
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.343
of what a pentest report looks like.

37
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.070
Now first of all, before I show you the sample that I have,

38
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.090
I'm gonna include this repository

39
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.090
which basically contains a large number of pentest reports.

40
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.730
So you could actually look through these for inspiration

41
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.440
and just to see the different styles

42
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.080
that different companies follow

43
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.180
when making a pentest report.

44
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.230
So you can click on any of these and you'll find the report,

45
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.760
and you can actually go through it

46
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.100
to learn how this specific company write their reports,

47
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.500
and maybe you find something that you like

48
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.030
that you would start including in your own reports.

49
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.840
So I'm gonna include this in the resources of the lecture

50
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.530
so you could come back to it for inspiration.

51
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.830
But what I really wanna do

52
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.770
is walk you through a sample report

53
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.040
that we use here in ZSecurity

54
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.600
just to give you an idea of the main sections

55
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.550
that most reports have.

56
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.010
I will also include this in the resources,

57
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.230
so feel free to modify it and use it,

58
00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.613
or take some elements of it if you want to.

59
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.670
So you'll notice from the repository in here,

60
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.070
each company has its own style of writing reports,

61
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.230
but in general, there is always a few main sections

62
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.513
that you will find in every report.

63
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.970
So starting with the first page right here,

64
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.820
we have the covering page.

65
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.729
So again, you can sell this as you want,

66
00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:47.400
you'll usually have the company logo,

67
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.960
you have the title,

68
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.500
and then you'll have the date of the report and the version,

69
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.250
this is very important.

70
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.340
And then, we have the company, our company information,

71
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.320
so this report written by us,

72
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.280
this is our company information.

73
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.850
And then you have in the for field,

74
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.880
you have the company that you're writing this report for.

75
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.750
So you'd have the company name,

76
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.610
you'll have a specific ID for this company.

77
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.410
This is the ID that you identify this company

78
00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.910
within your own records.

79
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.380
Again, this is probably not something

80
00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.410
you'll be doing yourself,

81
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.480
you'll be given this ID by your own company.

82
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.680
And then we have contact information for both companies.

83
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.090
So you can see in this company, we have pentester 1

84
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.810
and pentester 2 with their email addresses,

85
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.560
this could be obviously a bigger list

86
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.200
with all of the team that is doing the pentest,

87
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.450
and similar to the company

88
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.260
that you're doing the pentest for,

89
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.070
again, you have their names,

90
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.543
their position in the company and their contact information.

91
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.500
Now, again, keep in mind,

92
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.670
you don't always have to style the first page like this,

93
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.930
but more or less, usually in the first page,

94
00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.250
you'll have the title, the date, the version,

95
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.780
and the contact information,

96
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:55.760
this is how we do it,

97
00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.510
but again, you can do it the way you want

98
00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.100
and you can draw inspiration

99
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.960
from the resource that I'm gonna include here.

100
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.790
Next, we usually have the table of contents.

101
00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:05.640
Again, as you can see,

102
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.260
simple stuff, usually we'll have in any kind of document.

103
00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.870
This will help you navigate throughout this whole document.

104
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.680
And like I said, in here,

105
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.490
we can see the main sections of any pentest report.

106
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:21.330
So it's very important to have an executive summary,

107
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.060
this is a summary of the whole engagement

108
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.820
that is designed for less technical people.

109
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.920
So it's supposed to give them an idea of your findings

110
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.130
without diving too deep in the technical details.

111
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.170
Then we have an engagement summary

112
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.640
where we detail the scope,

113
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.640
so this is what you tested,

114
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.150
which parts of their system that you tested,

115
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.340
the risk ratings that you used

116
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.960
and an overview of everything that you found.

117
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.310
So again, so far we're not diving deep

118
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.830
or simply, this is just a summary of the whole engagement.

119
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.560
You'll get a better idea of all of this

120
00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.690
as I go through the report.

121
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.600
And then in the technical details section,

122
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.530
this is where you dive really deep

123
00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.340
in everything that you found.

124
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.170
So we basically have a section for every finding.

125
00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:10.920
So as you can see, this is just a sample,

126
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.760
so I only made three findings,

127
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.970
we have an SQL injection, a Cross-Site Request Forgery,

128
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.283
a CSRF and an information disclosure.

129
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:21.960
So as you can see in the first section,

130
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.010
we basically just have the summary of everything

131
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.960
that we found,

132
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.620
whereas in the technical details,

133
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.760
we're basically breaking down every single finding,

134
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.610
and we're gonna talk about how we found it in details,

135
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:33.760
how to replicate it,

136
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.230
you're going to include screenshots if you can

137
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.570
so that the technical team can understand

138
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.720
exactly the severity of this vulnerability

139
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.983
and how to fix it.

140
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.340
You'll notice other companies will include appendix

141
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.173
at the end,

142
00:05:48.173 --> 00:05:50.660
they will include recommendations where they will tell you

143
00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.860
exactly how to fix vulnerabilities.

144
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.260
Like I said, it really depends on the company,

145
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.130
every single company have their own style,

146
00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.760
and every single company have their own format.

147
00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.910
So what I'm showing you right here

148
00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:02.950
is just a sample of how we do it,

149
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.290
you can draw inspiration from the resources,

150
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:06.490
and in many cases,

151
00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.510
you'll just have to follow the template

152
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.850
that your company has because they don't want you to do it

153
00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:12.683
your own way.

154
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.590
So let's go to the next page,

155
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.160
and you'll see in this page,

156
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.200
we have the legal information.

157
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.700
And that's why I actually said,

158
00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.360
you'll probably not do this yourself,

159
00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.130
you'll never need to do this yourself

160
00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:27.570
because you'll have parts of the report like this

161
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.170
you'll never have to modify,

162
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.920
and they'll actually be written by the legal team

163
00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.170
in your company.

164
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:36.470
So they'll account for anything that could go out of control

165
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.280
to make sure that you will not be sued

166
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.160
if anything goes wrong,

167
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.830
it'll contain stuff like disclaimers, GDPR, privacy,

168
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.700
legal stuff, and all of that stuff

169
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.510
that we don't really know very well as pentesters

170
00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.290
and legal people usually write.

171
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:55.500
And then we have the change log of the document.

172
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.450
So every time a change is made to the document,

173
00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.090
you can see, we have the date,

174
00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:02.600
we have the version and we have a comment,

175
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.850
why did we do this change?

176
00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:06.440
Or what's so significant about this change?

177
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.710
So this was the initial report when we made it

178
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:10.330
on January 1st,

179
00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:11.840
and then on the 10th of January,

180
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.240
we made the second version

181
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.550
where we are done with the Recon Stage.

182
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:17.080
Again, this is just samples,

183
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.690
but just to give you an idea that keeping a change log

184
00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.260
of all of the changes that this document goes through

185
00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.310
is very, very important.

186
00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:25.760
Not all of the companies do it,

187
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.760
but again, that's just our own choice

188
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.310
to add it in our report.

189
00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.290
I keep saying this just to give you an idea

190
00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:32.900
that there is no set rules

191
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.850
to making these kinds of documents.

192
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.180
You can add or remove anything you want,

193
00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.690
but the main parts would be the legal part,

194
00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:42.230
the executive summary, and then the technical part,

195
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:45.083
these would be the main parts of the report.

196
00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.310
So now we have the executive summary,

197
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.760
and you could read through this.

198
00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.240
This is not supposed to be long,

199
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.180
so in my opinion,

200
00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.760
it needs to be a page, maximum two pages

201
00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.220
if you really have to.

202
00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.730
And it basically just says,

203
00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:01.860
we were instructed to test X system,

204
00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.890
it'll explain how this document is organized,

205
00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:06.820
where the first section is less detailed,

206
00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.890
just to give you an idea of the risk,

207
00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:11.450
and then the second one is detailed for the technical people

208
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.760
to understand these risks and fix them.

209
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.550
And then we're given the risk rating,

210
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:18.550
so we're assuming this is at high risk

211
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:20.840
based on the vulnerabilities we found,

212
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.300
it will detail the methodology that we followed.

213
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.290
And then, we have some charts in here.

214
00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:29.040
Remember, this part has been read by the executives,

215
00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.190
these are people that are not very technical

216
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:34.950
most of the time, and they also don't have a lot of time.

217
00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:36.900
So we're including graphs in here

218
00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.650
to show them the amount of vulnerabilities we found.

219
00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:43.540
So we can see, we have five vulnerabilities that are high,

220
00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:47.540
we have 10 that are medium and eight are low.

221
00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.820
So this will give them a really good understanding

222
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:52.090
of the threats that they face.

223
00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:54.280
And then we're gonna go into the summary.

224
00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.670
Again, this will still be read by the less technical people.

225
00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.970
So first of all, we're detailing the scope

226
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.390
to make sure that we tell them what we tested,

227
00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.610
even though they already told us what to test,

228
00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.740
just so that in case, in the future,

229
00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.270
if something was discovered outside of our scope

230
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:10.230
and they come back to us,

231
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:12.790
we can say, well, this was outside of the scope,

232
00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:14.093
we did not test this.

233
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.200
Next, we're including the risk ratings.

234
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.900
So you'll have this in every document

235
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.600
you want me to modify it,

236
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.600
we're basically just saying how we would classify

237
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.510
a certain vulnerability as low, medium, high, or critical.

238
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:29.520
And we're saying, in our opinion,

239
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.840
how you should handle the low, medium, high,

240
00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.540
and critical vulnerabilities.

241
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:34.860
You can see for the critical,

242
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.880
we're saying you need to fix immediately,

243
00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.640
whereas for the low, you need to fix

244
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.410
in the next update cycle.

245
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:42.740
Again, this is just our own opinion.

246
00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.860
Next, we have the findings overview.

247
00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.220
So we're still in section one,

248
00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.820
this is still for the executives,

249
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.670
we don't need to dive too deep.

250
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:52.350
So we're just given the vulnerability ID.

251
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:55.650
And you can see, for the first vulnerability, it's critical,

252
00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:57.620
it's an SQL injection.

253
00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.490
And in many cases, in many reports,

254
00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:02.930
they'll actually stop at saying, it's just an SQL injection.

255
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:06.270
We like to actually show the impact in this section,

256
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:08.480
because like I said, these guys are not technical,

257
00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.260
so if they read SQL injection,

258
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.030
they might not know what an SQL injection is,

259
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:16.730
what they care about is the impact of this vulnerability.

260
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:18.480
Again, they don't have a lot of time,

261
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.550
so you need to be straight to the point,

262
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:23.140
so what we're doing is we're saying it's an SQL injection

263
00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:26.010
that could lead to an authorized database access.

264
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:27.990
So now they know with this vulnerability,

265
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:29.590
a hacker can access their database,

266
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:32.200
this is probably pretty bad.

267
00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.060
Another vulnerability that we found is medium,

268
00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:38.570
and the CSRF again, many reports will stop here,

269
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:41.230
doesn't really explain anything to non-technical people.

270
00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:43.880
So we're saying clients can be forced to submit certain

271
00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.630
non-critical requests, that's why it's a medium,

272
00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:48.580
it's not non-critical requests,

273
00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:51.350
but they can be forced to submit stuff.

274
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.210
And then we have one low vulnerability

275
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:55.600
where the PHP version is disclosed,

276
00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.610
so this is not really very critical

277
00:10:57.610 --> 00:10:59.560
because it's not an actual vulnerability

278
00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:04.120
that can be exploited to gain access or expose user data,

279
00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.060
but this information could be useful for hackers

280
00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:08.550
to chain with other attacks

281
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:12.400
or discover vulnerabilities for this specific PHP version,

282
00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.510
and that's why it's allowed,

283
00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:15.870
that's why it doesn't need to be taken care of

284
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:17.940
very urgently like the critical ones

285
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.593
as we mentioned above in here.

286
00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:23.800
And feel free to read the text in here,

287
00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.910
you'll see a lot of it is basically just to clear our bugs

288
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:29.320
and make sure that they understand everything

289
00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.583
that is in the report.

290
00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:34.910
And that would be the end of the summary,

291
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:37.550
and now we're into the technical details.

292
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:41.410
So in this section, we're basically having, like I said,

293
00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:44.780
a subsection for every single finding that we have,

294
00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:47.310
and we're diving really deep into the details

295
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:49.080
of this finding.

296
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.970
So you can see this is the SQL injection

297
00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:53.160
that we mentioned earlier in the summary,

298
00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.440
but this time we're actually giving them the URL

299
00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.400
that is vulnerable,

300
00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.070
we're giving them the vulnerable parameter,

301
00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:01.050
we're giving them references to understand

302
00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:04.730
what SQL injection is in case they don't understand it,

303
00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:06.550
we're giving them the exact request

304
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.250
and the exact response that we got,

305
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:12.640
which made us determine that this particular page

306
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.823
is vulnerable to an SQL injection.

307
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.180
Then we're giving them the impact here in details,

308
00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.610
not just saying that they can access the database,

309
00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:22.350
so we're saying they can access the database,

310
00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:23.920
they can retrieve data,

311
00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.090
we got access to the user's table,

312
00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:27.520
so you're gonna dive in details

313
00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:30.090
and you should even include screenshots in here

314
00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:32.370
if you think there'll be useful.

315
00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:33.570
In the mitigation section,

316
00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:35.610
we're just giving them a quick recommendation,

317
00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:39.110
like I said, some companies give detailed recommendations,

318
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.580
this really depends on the engagement as well.

319
00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.990
So in this example, we're basically just saying,

320
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:47.440
use prepared statements with parameterized queries,

321
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.430
and we're giving them a reference to learn how to do that

322
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.250
or to understand how it works.

323
00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:54.083
And that's pretty much it.

324
00:12:54.083 --> 00:12:55.940
So you're gonna repeat that for every single

325
00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:57.360
vulnerability you found,

326
00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:01.310
I'm leaving the rest empty as this is just a sample,

327
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:02.390
but you get the idea.

328
00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:05.480
So you're gonna have a subsection for every finding

329
00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.570
that you have, explain everything in details

330
00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:10.420
so the understand the vulnerability

331
00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.403
and then they can go ahead and fix it.

332
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:16.360
At the end, many companies would have an appendix

333
00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.480
and they might have a bigger recommendation section,

334
00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.210
like I said, this is our style of writing reports,

335
00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:24.800
but each company has their own style.

336
00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.560
If you like this, maybe spend some time

337
00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.240
going through the sample reports

338
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.000
that we have in this repository.

339
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.970
Obviously I'll include both links for my sample

340
00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:34.970
and for the other samples in the resources

341
00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:36.960
so you can go through them yourself

342
00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:40.050
and get an idea of what pentest reports look like.

343
00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:41.650
But like I said, in many cases,

344
00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:43.750
you'll simply be filling a sample

345
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:45.330
similar to what we have in here,

346
00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:48.373
so you'll never be asked to come up with one from scratch.
