WEBVTT

00:00.210 --> 00:03.236
-: Now you have enough information to go ahead

00:03.236 --> 00:06.420
and try to gain access to other systems

00:06.420 --> 00:10.280
to computers, servers, web servers and stuff like that.

00:10.280 --> 00:13.230
And in this section we're gonna be talking

00:13.230 --> 00:16.584
about gaining access to computer devices.

00:16.584 --> 00:21.080
And what I mean by computer devices is any electronic device

00:21.080 --> 00:23.220
you see is as a computer.

00:23.220 --> 00:25.579
So a phone, a TV, a laptop

00:25.579 --> 00:29.498
a web server, a website, a network, a router.

00:29.498 --> 00:31.923
All of these things are computers.

00:31.923 --> 00:33.784
All of them have an operating system

00:33.784 --> 00:37.523
and they have programs installed on these operating systems.

00:37.523 --> 00:41.098
And usually, in most cases these computers

00:41.098 --> 00:43.315
are used by a user.

00:43.315 --> 00:45.000
So you have an operating system,

00:45.000 --> 00:48.059
they have programs installed on that operating system

00:48.059 --> 00:50.520
and they have a user who uses them

00:50.520 --> 00:52.723
and configures this system.

00:52.723 --> 00:55.650
So I'm gonna be talking about how you gain access

00:55.650 --> 00:59.640
to computers in this example, an actual personal computer.

00:59.640 --> 01:02.880
So the name that people call it usually i.e. a computer.

01:02.880 --> 01:05.820
So we're gonna have a target of a Windows device

01:05.820 --> 01:08.201
and we're gonna have a target of a Linux device.

01:08.201 --> 01:11.860
But the concept is always the same.

01:11.860 --> 01:15.480
Getting access to computer devices is always the same.

01:15.480 --> 01:17.266
So you can apply the same concepts

01:17.266 --> 01:18.960
if you are targeting a phone

01:18.960 --> 01:21.090
if you're targeting a tablet,

01:21.090 --> 01:22.470
if you're targeting a web server.

01:22.470 --> 01:24.530
And we will be targeting web servers as well.

01:24.530 --> 01:28.890
But I will be talking about it just like a normal computer.

01:28.890 --> 01:30.632
This is very important to understand.

01:30.632 --> 01:34.050
Every device you see is a computer

01:34.050 --> 01:36.690
and it works just like your personal computer.

01:36.690 --> 01:39.180
So I can set up a web server on my computer

01:39.180 --> 01:42.060
I can make it look like a website and act as a website.

01:42.060 --> 01:43.920
I can make it act as a TV,

01:43.920 --> 01:46.013
and I can make it act as anything I want.

01:46.013 --> 01:48.810
And literally, TVs and all these things are just

01:48.810 --> 01:52.936
simpler computers with less complicated hardware in them.

01:52.936 --> 01:57.750
So we're gonna be talking about attacking these devices

01:57.750 --> 02:00.632
from two main parts or from two main sites.

02:00.632 --> 02:03.900
The first approach that we're going to use is

02:03.900 --> 02:05.460
the server site.

02:05.460 --> 02:08.910
So in this site it doesn't require any user interaction.

02:08.910 --> 02:11.517
We're gonna have a computer and we're gonna see how

02:11.517 --> 02:15.240
we can gain access to that computer without the need

02:15.240 --> 02:17.490
for the user to do anything for the user who

02:17.490 --> 02:19.740
uses that computer to do anything.

02:19.740 --> 02:21.870
All we have is gonna be an IP address

02:21.870 --> 02:23.954
and we're gonna see how we can test the security

02:23.954 --> 02:26.953
and gain access to that computer based on that IP.

02:26.953 --> 02:31.107
So our main way of getting in is gonna be the operating

02:31.107 --> 02:34.781
system that that target runs and the applications installed

02:34.781 --> 02:36.207
on that system.

02:36.207 --> 02:39.330
The second approach that we're gonna try

02:39.330 --> 02:40.980
is the client side attacks.

02:40.980 --> 02:44.146
So this approach will require the client or the person

02:44.146 --> 02:46.583
who uses that computer to do something.

02:46.583 --> 02:49.080
It could be install an update, it could be

02:49.080 --> 02:52.230
opening a picture, it could be opening a Trojan.

02:52.230 --> 02:54.600
So we're gonna learn how to create a Trojan, how to create

02:54.600 --> 02:58.980
back doors, how to use social engineering to make

02:58.980 --> 03:01.170
the target person do something

03:01.170 --> 03:02.701
and when they do that action

03:02.701 --> 03:05.197
we will gain access to their computer.

03:05.197 --> 03:07.770
Information gathering is gonna be crucial

03:07.770 --> 03:09.450
in this case because we actually need to

03:09.450 --> 03:11.793
know the person that we're targeting.

03:12.630 --> 03:13.710
After all of that,

03:13.710 --> 03:16.590
I'm gonna talk about the post exploitation.

03:16.590 --> 03:20.010
So what you could do after you gain access to this computer

03:20.010 --> 03:22.860
regardless of the method that you gained access to it.

03:22.860 --> 03:25.200
So you could have used a server side exploit

03:25.200 --> 03:27.630
you could have used a client side exploit

03:27.630 --> 03:29.820
or you could have just got a physical access,

03:29.820 --> 03:31.377
the person left their desk and you got in.

03:31.377 --> 03:34.498
So we're gonna see what can you do once you have access

03:34.498 --> 03:37.437
to your target, how you could further exploit that target

03:37.437 --> 03:39.390
and increase your privileges

03:39.390 --> 03:41.883
or target other computers in the same place.
