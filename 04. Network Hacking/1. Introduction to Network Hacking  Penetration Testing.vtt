00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.290
<v ->The first penetration testing section</v>

2
00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:04.820
in this course is gonna be

3
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.230
the network hacking section.

4
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.470
The reason why I chose

5
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:09.690
to start with this,

6
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.140
because everything,

7
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.260
if you think of it,

8
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.240
is connected to a network.

9
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.610
So, whether you're target

10
00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.240
is a personal computer,

11
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.630
whether it's a server,

12
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.960
whether it's a company

13
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.110
or even if it's just a website,

14
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.840
all of these systems

15
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.460
are actually connected to a network.

16
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.820
Literally when you just connect

17
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.810
to the internet,

18
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.230
you're connecting to a network

19
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.230
because the internet

20
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.639
is just a really really big network.

21
00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:35.383
So, it is very important

22
00:00:35.383 --> 00:00:36.900
that you understand

23
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.250
how networks work

24
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.030
and how devices communicate

25
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.863
with each other

26
00:00:40.863 --> 00:00:42.418
before we actually move

27
00:00:42.418 --> 00:00:44.870
into the next sections.

28
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.020
So, this section

29
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.630
is actually gonna be divided

30
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.810
into three subsections.

31
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.340
In the first subsection

32
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.700
we're gonna talk about

33
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.010
all of the attacks

34
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.190
that you can do

35
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.330
before connecting to a network.

36
00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.310
So you literally just have a computer

37
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.070
with a network interface,

38
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.860
possibly a Wi-Fi adapter

39
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:04.603
and we're gonna see

40
00:01:04.603 --> 00:01:05.780
what can you do now

41
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.063
before even connecting to anything.

42
00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.420
In the section subsection

43
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.253
I'm gonna show you

44
00:01:11.253 --> 00:01:13.310
how to crack Wi-Fi keys

45
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.950
and gain access to Wi-Fi networks,

46
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.110
whether they use WEP,

47
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.943
WPA,

48
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.453
or WPA2.

49
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.180
Once you have the access,

50
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.430
you can move to the third section

51
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.990
which will apply for both

52
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.700
Wi-Fi and wired networks.

53
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.360
All of the attacks that you will learn

54
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.050
in the third subsection

55
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.330
apply whenever you are able

56
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.630
to connect to the network.

57
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.498
Once you're able to gain access

58
00:01:39.498 --> 00:01:41.580
to the network.

59
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.800
And here is where the real fun starts,

60
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.030
because you're gonna learn

61
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.917
a number of powerful attacks

62
00:01:46.917 --> 00:01:49.050
that will allow you to intercept

63
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.970
the connections in the network

64
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.330
and capture everything sent in it,

65
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.870
including usernames,

66
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.749
passwords, URLs, chat messages,

67
00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:58.582
and so on.

68
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.623
Not only that,

69
00:02:00.623 --> 00:02:03.010
but you'll also be able to modify data

70
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.070
as it's being sent in the air.

71
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.470
So you'll be able to control the requests,

72
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.410
serve people fake updates,

73
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.484
inject evil code

74
00:02:10.484 --> 00:02:12.960
into the pages that they load

75
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.620
and so many other cool things.

76
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.790
So everything in the third section

77
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.553
will apply for both Wi-Fi and wired networks.
