<v ->When it comes to networking,</v>

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.883
you've probably heard of the term MAC address a lot.

3
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.060
So in this lecture,

4
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.820
I'm gonna cover what do we mean by MAC address,

5
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.993
what it's used for, and how to change it.

6
00:00:13.993 --> 00:00:15.632
(dramatic music)

7
00:00:15.632 --> 00:00:18.215
(loud banging)

8
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.550
MAC address stands for Media Access Control,

9
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.850
it's a permanent, physical, and unique address

10
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.170
assigned to network interfaces

11
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.590
by the device manufacturer.

12
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.560
So whether you have a wireless card,

13
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.990
or a wired, or Ethernet card,

14
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.000
each one of these network cards

15
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.960
come with a specific address that is unique to this card.

16
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.490
So there is no two devices in the world

17
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.690
that would have the same MAC address.

18
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.970
And this address will always be the same

19
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.720
to this specific device,

20
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.040
even if you unplug it from your computer,

21
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.890
connect it to another computer,

22
00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.343
then this network device will always have the same address.

23
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.160
So you might already know that the IP address

24
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.070
is used in the internet to identify computers,

25
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.900
and communicate between devices on the internet.

26
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.850
The MAC address is used within the network

27
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.423
to identify devices and transfer data between devices.

28
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.730
So each piece of data or packet

29
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.660
that is sent within the network

30
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.900
contains a source MAC and a destination MAC.

31
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.120
Therefore, this packet would flow

32
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.863
from the source MAC to the destination MAC.

33
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.440
So because this is a physical unique address

34
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.710
to each interface, to each network device,

35
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.010
and because it is used to identify devices,

36
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.673
then changing it will make you anonymous on the network.

37
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.460
Not only that, but the MAC address is often used

38
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.660
by filters to prevent or allow devices

39
00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.160
to connect to networks,

40
00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.040
and do specific tasks on the network.

41
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.080
So being able to change your MAC address

42
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.080
to another device's MAC address

43
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.870
will allow you to impersonate this device

44
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.830
and allow you to do things

45
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.040
that you might not be able to do.

46
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.280
So you'd be able to bypass filters,

47
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.450
or connect to networks that only specific devices

48
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.290
with specific MAC addresses can connect to,

49
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.333
and you will also be able to hide your identity.

50
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.300
Now changing the MAC address is very, very simple,

51
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.313
so let me show you how to do that.

52
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.540
First of all, I'm going to use the ifconfig command

53
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.250
to list all the network interfaces

54
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.783
available on my Kali machine.

55
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.540
What I mean by network interface is any device

56
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.360
that allow us to connect to a network.

57
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.610
So an example is a Wi-Fi card,

58
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.223
or an Ethernet card, and so on.

59
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.030
So you can see first of all we have eth0,

60
00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.750
and this is a virtual interface created by virtual box

61
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.993
when we set Kali to use iNet network.

62
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.890
So you can see the interface name is eth0,

63
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.990
you can see it has an IP address because like I said,

64
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.780
it's connected to a network.

65
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.723
So if we go here, we can see it saying Wired Connected.

66
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.350
So this is the interface that represents the wired network

67
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.420
that Kali is connected to,

68
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.803
which is actually a virtual NAT network.

69
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.950
You can also see the netmask, the broadcast,

70
00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.030
and a really important piece of information,

71
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.453
which is the ether.

72
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.203
This is the MAC address of this virtual interface.

73
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.150
Now, you can see similar information

74
00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.150
for my other two interfaces, the lo and the lan0.

75
00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.040
The only thing is you can see for both of these interfaces,

76
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.210
we do not have an IP address.

77
00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:57.870
And the main reason for that

78
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.670
is because none of these interfaces

79
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.453
is connected to a network.

80
00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.780
Now lo is the default interface created by Linux,

81
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.810
and lan0 is my real wireless adapter,

82
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.710
so I can use it to connect to Wi-Fi networks.

83
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.530
But if I go on the network in here,

84
00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.150
you'll see Wi-Fi is not connected,

85
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.170
because I actually didn't connect to any network,

86
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.723
and that's why it does not have an IP address.

87
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.010
Now, this doesn't matter because what we want to do

88
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.740
is to just change the MAC address,

89
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.250
which again, is shown here under the ether part,

90
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.863
so similar to what you're seeing here for eth0.

91
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.960
Now, in order to change any of the values

92
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.510
that you see in here,

93
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.093
you have to first disable the interface.

94
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.200
So in this example, we want to change the MAC address,

95
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.820
so that is represented by the ether

96
00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.913
and the value is right here.

97
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.870
So in order to disable an interface,

98
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.480
we're gonna do ifconfig followed by the interface name,

99
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.480
which is lan0 in my example, followed by down to disable it.

100
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.700
Now, if I hit Enter, you'll see

101
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.730
the command runs with no errors,

102
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.310
so it means that it got executed properly.

103
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.320
And the next thing that we need to do,

104
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.750
is to change the option that we want to change.

105
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.910
And in this example, we want to change the ether,

106
00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.963
which is the MAC address.

107
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.283
So first, we're gonna type ifconfig,

108
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.350
we're gonna type the interface that we want to change,

109
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:45.960
one of its options, then we're gonna type

110
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.440
the option that we want to change.

111
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.100
And what we want to change is the hardware address,

112
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.323
so we're gonna do hw ether.

113
00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.420
Then we're gonna give it the address

114
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.520
that we want to change the MAC address to.

115
00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.520
So for example, I'm gonna use 00:11:22:33:44:55.

116
00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.670
Very, very simple command,

117
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:16.210
we're doing ifconfig lan0 to select the interface

118
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.410
that we want to change its option,

119
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.160
we wanna set the hardware address,

120
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.670
and we wanna set this address to this specific address.

121
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:27.810
So you can use any address that you want,

122
00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.370
following the same format shown here.

123
00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.963
Just make sure your address starts with 00.

124
00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.270
So I'm gonna hit Enter and again,

125
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.020
we don't see any error messages,

126
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.470
so it means the command got executed properly.

127
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.560
And finally, we just need to enable the interface

128
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.360
because we disabled it, by doing, ifconfig lan0 down,

129
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.360
so we just need to do, ifconfig lan0 up, to enable it.

130
00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.881
Now the interface is enabled,

131
00:06:59.881 --> 00:07:02.393
and if we do ifconfig again,

132
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.610
and look at the ether part in here,

133
00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.310
you can see that it is changed

134
00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.953
to the MAC address that we specified.

135
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:16.840
Now, this is done, and your MAC address has changed.

136
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.700
Now, you can go ahead and start using the interface

137
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.700
and it'll appear to have this MAC address

138
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.290
instead of its original MAC address.

139
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:30.543
And like I said, this can be useful in so many scenarios.

140
00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:35.670
Now, keep in mind, the MAC address will revert back

141
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:39.520
to the original one once you restart the computer,

142
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.170
because we're only changing the MAC address in memory,

143
00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:47.070
we're not really changing the physical MAC address.

144
00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:49.970
But if your MAC address is resetting

145
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:53.140
to the original one without restarting,

146
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.840
then something is going wrong.

147
00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:58.240
And it's probably happening because your network manager

148
00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.970
is resetting the MAC address.

149
00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:03.130
Not everybody will face this issue,

150
00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:05.730
so I'm not gonna cover it in this lecture,

151
00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:07.520
but if you face this issue,

152
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.360
if your MAC address goes back to the original one

153
00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.690
without restarting the computer,

154
00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:14.860
then check out the YouTube video

155
00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.950
in the resources of this lecture,

156
00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:19.543
it'll show you how to fix this issue.
