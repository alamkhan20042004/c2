00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.390
<v Instructor>In this lecture, I'm gonna show you</v>

2
00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:07.390
how to connect a USB device to a virtual machine.

3
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.180
As an example, I'll be connecting a wireless adapter

4
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.430
to the virtual Kali machine,

5
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.320
but this method can be used

6
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.623
to connect any type of USB adapter.

7
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.600
As mentioned in the course requirements,

8
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.010
you need a wireless adapter for the cracking sections

9
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.540
of the course.

10
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.040
These two sections account for less than 8% of the course.

11
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.840
So, if you don't have a wireless adapter

12
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.850
and can't afford to buy one, then that's completely fine.

13
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.520
You could simply skip these two sections,

14
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.230
continue from the network hacking post-exploitation section,

15
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.650
and you'll be able to do everything else in the course

16
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.783
without a wireless adapter.

17
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.790
Now, what we mean by a wireless adapter

18
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.570
is simply a USB device

19
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.410
that you connect to your computer

20
00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.660
and it allows your computer to communicate

21
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.570
with Wi-Fi networks.

22
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.940
Now, most modern computers come

23
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.000
with built-in wireless cards.

24
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.760
The only problem is these built-in wireless cards

25
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.540
are not good for hacking.

26
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.450
The Wi-Fi or wireless adapter that we need

27
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.960
needs to support monitor mode, packet injection,

28
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.293
and AP mode.

29
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.630
I will include a video in the resources

30
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.760
to help you pick a good wireless adapter.

31
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.010
And don't worry about what we mean by these modes.

32
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.000
We will talk about this as we go through the course,

33
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.660
but, basically, you need to get a wireless adapter

34
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.880
that supports all of these three modes

35
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.750
and it should be supported by Kali Linux.

36
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.310
The main thing you want to keep in mind

37
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.800
is the brand does not matter.

38
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.270
What you need to look for is any adapter

39
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.740
that uses any of these two chip sets.

40
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.520
The chip set is the brains of the wireless adapter.

41
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.060
It's what does most of the work and, therefore,

42
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.140
if you get any adapter, regardless of what brand it is,

43
00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.730
if it uses any of these two chip sets,

44
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.110
it should support all of these modes

45
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.527
and it should work with everything that I'm gonna do

46
00:02:04.527 --> 00:02:07.240
and you'll learn in this course.

47
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.730
So anyway, check out the video in the resources

48
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:14.000
for more information on how to pick a good wireless adapter.

49
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.570
I'm also gonna include the link in the resources

50
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.120
for our own shop where we sell supported wireless adapters,

51
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.040
but you do not have to buy it from us.

52
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.520
You can buy it from anywhere,

53
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.090
as long as you get an adapter

54
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.660
that uses one of the recommended chipsets.

55
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.850
The wireless adapter that I'm gonna be connecting

56
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.480
to this computer is actually gonna be this one

57
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.340
that uses the Realtek 8812AU chip set.

58
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.090
You can follow the same instructions

59
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.990
for whatever wireless adapter,

60
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.840
as long as it's supported by Kali.

61
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.663
So what we need to do is simply run VMware.

62
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.270
We're gonna click on the Kali machine.

63
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.220
We're gonna right click it and go to its settings.

64
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.883
We're gonna click on add in here to add a USB controller.

65
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.750
We're gonna select that we want to add

66
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.630
a USB controller in here.

67
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.383
We're gonna click on finish,

68
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.500
and in the settings for the USB compatibility,

69
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.783
I'm going to set this to 3.1.

70
00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.120
I'm gonna click on show all USB input devices,

71
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.780
and we're gonna click on OK.

72
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.340
And we're done.

73
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.300
Now before starting Kali,

74
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.500
make sure that you disconnect the wireless adapter.

75
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.600
So if you already have it connected to your computer,

76
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.560
physically disconnect it

77
00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.480
from the USB port from the computer.

78
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.910
Make sure you do that before starting Kali.

79
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.313
So, I'm gonna go ahead and start it.

80
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.030
I'm gonna log in.

81
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.030
Once logged in, let's go and open up our terminal.

82
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.120
And I'm gonna run ifconfig.

83
00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.130
This command is used to list

84
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.280
all of the network interfaces

85
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.920
connected to this computer.

86
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.170
And if I hit enter,

87
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.430
you'll see right now I have two interfaces.

88
00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.260
One of them is called eth0.

89
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.300
This is a virtual ethernet interface

90
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.020
that is actually created by VMware,

91
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.360
in order to connect this machine

92
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.030
through the virtual NOC network.

93
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.820
You also have lo,

94
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.520
which is the virtual loopback interface used in Linux.

95
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.150
So both of these are virtual interfaces.

96
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.940
None of them is our wireless adapter,

97
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:30.870
but that is normal

98
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.020
because I haven't connected my wireless adapter yet.

99
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.170
So I'm gonna go ahead and connect it to my computer.

100
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.330
And as you can see, as soon as I do that,

101
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.030
we're gonna get a popup.

102
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.720
The popup is asking us, what do we want to do with this?

103
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.060
Do we want to connect it to the host?

104
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.580
So the host is the main computer, the Windows computer.

105
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.060
Or do we want to connect it to the virtual machine?

106
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.870
Now, we obviously want to connect it

107
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.890
to the virtual machine, so I'm selecting this option.

108
00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.520
This is the virtual machine that we're connecting it to,

109
00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.900
which is my Kali machine.

110
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.360
That is perfect.

111
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.700
And we're gonna tick this box

112
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.590
so that it always connects it

113
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.240
to this machine in the future.

114
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.683
It won't show me this popup message.

115
00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:14.383
Once we do that,

116
00:05:14.383 --> 00:05:16.980
we're gonna see another popup that simply tells us

117
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.860
that we can always connect and disconnect USB devices

118
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.460
using the USB icon in here on the top right.

119
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.293
So that's fine.

120
00:05:25.293 --> 00:05:28.240
I'm gonna say thank you, don't show me this either.

121
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.275
We're gonna click on OK.

122
00:05:30.275 --> 00:05:35.275
And now, if we run the exact same command, ifconfig, again,

123
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.090
you'll notice that I have another interface.

124
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.810
So we still have eth0, which is like I said,

125
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.600
the virtual interface that is used to connect

126
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.710
to the virtual NOC network.

127
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.160
We also still have lo, the loopback interface,

128
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.250
and we have a new interface right now called, lan0,

129
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.230
which is my wireless adapter that I just connected to Kali.

130
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.020
So now we can go ahead and use this adapter

131
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.290
to discover wireless networks around us and hack them.

132
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.340
And we will talk about that in details in the next lectures.

133
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.690
And as mentioned, you only need this for 10% of the course,

134
00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.563
only for the cracking section.

135
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.510
Also, now, if we look here on the top right,

136
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.880
you'll notice that we have an option for Wi-Fi,

137
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.250
and if we click on it,

138
00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:28.120
we can select a network and connect to a Wi-Fi network.

139
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.640
Now, I don't want to do that,

140
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.010
and you should not do that because we don't need to do this.

141
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.810
We don't need the wireless adapter

142
00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.890
to connect to Wi-Fi networks.

143
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.420
We already have internet access in here

144
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:43.060
through the virtual NOC network through eth0.

145
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.420
We're only using the wireless adapter

146
00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:49.140
to actually discover wireless networks and hack them,

147
00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.903
not to connect to them.
