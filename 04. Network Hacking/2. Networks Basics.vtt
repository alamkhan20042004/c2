00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:02.300
<v Instructor>Now, before we start talking</v>

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.310
about network hacking,

3
00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.240
you need to have a basic understanding

4
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.033
on how networks work.

5
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.440
Now, we all know that a network usually contains

6
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.290
a number of clients connected to each other,

7
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.250
and clients usually connect to a network

8
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.223
in order to share data or share a resource.

9
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.570
A really good example of a resource

10
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.400
that we all have connected to networks

11
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.263
in order to access is the internet.

12
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.640
So, we connect to Wi-Fi networks and even wired networks

13
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.603
all the time just to access the internet.

14
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.460
Now, all networks, whether it's Wi-Fi or wired,

15
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.130
work on the same principle.

16
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.890
They have a device that is considered as server.

17
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.200
Now, in many cases, for example, in your home network,

18
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.773
this server is your router.

19
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.823
This is also referred to as an access point.

20
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.380
Now, this router or server or access point

21
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.380
is the only device that has access to the resource.

22
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.130
So, none of these clients have direct access

23
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.863
to the resource, even after connecting to the network.

24
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.680
The only way they can access the resource

25
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.223
is through the access point.

26
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.690
So, let's say, for example, you're client number one

27
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.970
and you connected to your home network

28
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.220
over Wi-Fi or over ethernet, over a cable

29
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.220
and then you opened your browser and you typed google.com.

30
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.910
What happens is your computer will send the request

31
00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.250
to the access point asking for google.com.

32
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.090
The access point has access to the resource,

33
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.540
which is the internet in this example,

34
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.823
so it's gonna go and look for google.com.

35
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.910
It will receive google.com,

36
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.780
and it'll forward that response to your computer,

37
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.370
and as a result you will see the website

38
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.483
loading on your browser.

39
00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.980
So if you actually go to your router at home

40
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.450
and look at it, you'll see at the back

41
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.350
it's connected through a cable to the wall

42
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.723
and this is how it's getting its internet access.

43
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.040
Therefore, it is the only device in your network

44
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.030
that has direct access to the resource

45
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.730
and none of your computers,

46
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.500
none of the computers connected to the network

47
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.130
can access the resource or can access the internet

48
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.480
without the router, without the access point.

49
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.560
So the only way for all of the connected clients

50
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.503
to access the resource is to go through the router.

51
00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.060
Now, the data is transferred between clients

52
00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.380
and the access point as packets.

53
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.900
So you can think of all of these arrows

54
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.160
as a series of packets being transmitted

55
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.160
between the client and the router as requests and responses.

56
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.380
Now, in Wi-Fi networks,

57
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.270
these packets are transmitted in the air.

58
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.030
Therefore, if you have a wireless card

59
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.260
and you're within range, you'll be able to capture

60
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.083
all of these requests and responses.

61
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.810
So, basically, you'll be able to see

62
00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.500
anything that any computer

63
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.340
connected to the same network as you,

64
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.880
thus on the internet,

65
00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.800
because they will have to send all of these data

66
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.100
to the access point,

67
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.030
and because they're sending this data in the air

68
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.520
because you're in a WiFi network,

69
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.470
you'll basically be able to capture

70
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.550
these requests and responses.

71
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.110
And you'll be able to see the URLs they visit,

72
00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.350
the usernames, the passwords they enter, the chat messages.

73
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.670
Anything they do on the internet will be sent as packets

74
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.433
and therefore you'll be able to capture it and analyze it.

75
00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.180
We'll talk more about that

76
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.520
and more about how networks work

77
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.560
as we go through the course

78
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.940
but this is enough to get you going

79
00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.050
through the next few lectures, so that you can sniff data,

80
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.060
analyze it and start launching

81
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.553
some cool pre-connection attacks.
