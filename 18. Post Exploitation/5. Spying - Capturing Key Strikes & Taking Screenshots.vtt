00:00.360 --> 00:03.690
Instructor: In this video, we'll see how we can log

00:03.690 --> 00:07.110
any mouse or keyboard event that happens

00:07.110 --> 00:09.060
on the target computer.

00:09.060 --> 00:11.850
We're gonna do that using a plugin, or a module,

00:11.850 --> 00:13.500
that comes in with Meterpreter,

00:13.500 --> 00:15.930
so I have my Meterpreter here already,

00:15.930 --> 00:17.640
and to do that, all you need to do

00:17.640 --> 00:19.773
is just type keyscan_start.

00:21.030 --> 00:22.770
Now, all of this exists in the help.

00:22.770 --> 00:25.110
If you run the help, you'll see it there,

00:25.110 --> 00:28.860
and now it started my keystroke sniffer.

00:28.860 --> 00:31.740
So I have my Firefox running here,

00:31.740 --> 00:34.773
and let's say I wanted to go to facebook.com,

00:36.270 --> 00:39.390
and then I wanted to log in to my, now, as you can see,

00:39.390 --> 00:42.930
it's HTTPS here, and nothing is wrong about it.

00:42.930 --> 00:45.900
Now, let's say I wanted to log in to my account,

00:45.900 --> 00:50.370
so I'm gonna put my account, zaid@isecurity.org,

00:50.370 --> 00:54.360
and let's say I put my password, which is 123456,

00:54.360 --> 00:55.860
Now, obviously, this is the wrong password,

00:55.860 --> 00:57.960
I'm just trying to show you here.

00:57.960 --> 01:01.080
Now, if we come back here to see the log

01:01.080 --> 01:03.180
of everything that has been recorded,

01:03.180 --> 01:05.043
we're gonna type in keyscan_dump.

01:10.710 --> 01:13.500
Now, as you can see, now we can see that the target person

01:13.500 --> 01:16.920
typed in facebook.com, hit enter,

01:16.920 --> 01:20.610
then they put their username, which is zaid@isecurity.org,

01:20.610 --> 01:24.750
hit tab, and then they put the password 123456.

01:24.750 --> 01:26.550
Now, this will obviously record everything

01:26.550 --> 01:28.410
that happens in there.

01:28.410 --> 01:30.760
To stop this, you can just do keyscan_stop

01:32.640 --> 01:34.263
and it'll stop the sniffer.

01:35.100 --> 01:36.810
Now, another cool thing that you can do

01:36.810 --> 01:38.973
is you can get a screenshot,

01:39.840 --> 01:42.003
so you can just type in screenshot,

01:45.660 --> 01:47.043
if I spelled that right,

01:48.540 --> 01:50.730
and it'll save it here for you in the root.

01:50.730 --> 01:52.833
Now, if I go to my browser,

01:54.360 --> 01:56.283
you'll see that I have a screenshot.

01:57.540 --> 01:59.250
I believe it's this one,

01:59.250 --> 02:02.790
and it's showing you what's here on the target computer.

02:02.790 --> 02:03.963
You can see it in here.

02:04.920 --> 02:07.230
Now, these are just two useful features.

02:07.230 --> 02:08.610
The keylogging is very useful

02:08.610 --> 02:11.160
because you can get usernames and passwords from it

02:11.160 --> 02:12.990
and see what the target person is doing.

02:12.990 --> 02:14.880
The screenshot, you can see them,

02:14.880 --> 02:17.460
kind of get an idea of what they're doing as well,

02:17.460 --> 02:21.810
but definitely, the keylogger is much more useful.

02:21.810 --> 02:24.930
Now, obviously, you can use other keylogger programs,

02:24.930 --> 02:27.540
like a portable key logger, and all you have to do

02:27.540 --> 02:29.490
is just upload it using the upload command

02:29.490 --> 02:31.713
that we learned before and execute it.
