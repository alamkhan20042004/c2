<v ->Now that we learned how we can gain access</v>

2
00:00:03.763 --> 00:00:07.220
to our target, let's see what we can do with

3
00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.530
that target.

4
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.001
So in this section, we're going to learn

5
00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:12.680
a number of things that we can do

6
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.250
after we gain access to the computer.

7
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.490
Now regardless of the way that you gain

8
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.748
the access to that computer,

9
00:00:18.748 --> 00:00:21.107
whether you use the server side exploit,

10
00:00:21.107 --> 00:00:23.720
whether you used social engineering,

11
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.681
if you used the backdoor, if you used a problem

12
00:00:26.681 --> 00:00:29.244
with a certain application, we're gonna assume

13
00:00:29.244 --> 00:00:31.870
that you gained your access to that computer

14
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.427
and we'll see what you can do after that access.

15
00:00:35.427 --> 00:00:37.110
In the previous videos,

16
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.050
I used to stop once I actually get something like

17
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.849
this. So once I get an interpreter session,

18
00:00:41.849 --> 00:00:45.360
then I stop and I go to the next lecture.

19
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.410
In this lecture and the next few lectures,

20
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.071
we're actually going to start by having

21
00:00:50.071 --> 00:00:51.590
an interpreter session.

22
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:52.900
So we're not going to talk about how we

23
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.900
gained our access.

24
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.170
We're gonna talk about the things that

25
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.923
we can do after we gained our access.

26
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.520
So we're going to talk about really

27
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.483
cool things. We're gonna see how you could

28
00:01:02.483 --> 00:01:05.580
maintain your access on the target computer.

29
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.901
So if the target computer, or the target person,

30
00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:11.126
uninstalls the vulnerable program or if they

31
00:01:11.126 --> 00:01:13.610
restart their program, their computer,

32
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.090
you'll still have access to that computer.

33
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.858
We'll see how you could download, upload,

34
00:01:18.858 --> 00:01:20.973
read files, open the web cam,

35
00:01:20.973 --> 00:01:23.450
start the key loggers. So you'll be able to

36
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.100
register any key strikes that the person does.

37
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.489
We'll also see how we can use the target computer

38
00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:31.290
as a pivot to exploit all the other

39
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.710
computers on the same network.

40
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.490
So, say for example your target wasn't actually

41
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.952
the person or computer that you hacked, but you

42
00:01:38.952 --> 00:01:41.410
can use the computer that you hacked

43
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.830
in order to hack your target computer if they

44
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.730
were on the same network, for example.

45
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.940
So again all of the attacks, all of the things

46
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.280
that we're gonna do in this section of the

47
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.170
course is the Post Exploitation section.

48
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.350
So anything that you can do after you exploited

49
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.780
your vulnerability and gained access to the

50
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.743
target computer.
