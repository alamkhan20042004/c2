00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:03.640
<v Instructor>Now that we have enabled monitor mode</v>

2
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.150
on our wireless interface,

3
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.556
we are able to capture all the wifi packets

4
00:00:09.556 --> 00:00:12.680
sent within our range,

5
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.390
even if the packet is not directed to our computer,

6
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.020
even if we're not connected to the target network,

7
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.690
and even without knowing the key

8
00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.800
or the password to the target network.

9
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.810
So all we need right now is a program

10
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.000
that can capture these packets for us.

11
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.240
The program that we're going to use is called Airodump-NG.

12
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.340
It's part of the Aircrack-NG suit,

13
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.040
and it's a packet-sniffer,

14
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.470
so it's basically a program designed

15
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.270
to capture packets while you're in monitor mode.

16
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.860
So it will allow us to see

17
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.530
all the wireless networks around us,

18
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.660
and show us detailed information about it's MAC address,

19
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.990
it's channel, it's encryption,

20
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.253
the clients connected to this network, and so on.

21
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.240
So, let me show you how we're gonna use it.

22
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.420
First of all, you need to enable monitor mode

23
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.593
on your wireless adapter, as shown in the previous lectures.

24
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.490
So, if I go to my Kali machine, and run iwconfig

25
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.233
to list all the wireless devices on this computer,

26
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.410
you'll see that I have an interface called mon0,

27
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.173
and this interface is in monitor mode.

28
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.500
Now dependent on the way that you enabled monitor mode,

29
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.200
this can be called lan0, it can be called lan0mon,

30
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.640
it doesn't really matter.

31
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.160
You just wanna make sure you enable monitor mode

32
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.560
using one of the methods shown before,

33
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.960
and then, use the name of the adapter

34
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.363
that is in monitor mode when you run Airodump-NG.

35
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.790
Now to run Airodump-NG,

36
00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.900
we're just gonna type the name of the program,

37
00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.183
which is airodump-ng,

38
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.680
followed by the name of my wireless adapter

39
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.680
in monitor mode, which is mon0, as you can see in here.

40
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.150
So the command is very simple.

41
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.650
We're typing the program name, which is airodump-ng,

42
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.990
followed by the name of my interface in monitor mode.

43
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.500
If I hit Enter, you'll see it'll start working,

44
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.960
discovering all the wireless networks around me,

45
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.063
and displaying useful information about them.

46
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.310
This program will continue working unless you quit it,

47
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.790
and to quit this program,

48
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.993
you have to press Control+C from your keyboard.

49
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.040
You can actually use Control+C

50
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.023
to quit any running program in your terminal.

51
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.390
Now that we stopped the program, let's analyze the output

52
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.283
so we understand what it's showing us.

53
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.390
So first of all, if we look at this column,

54
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.930
the ESSID column, it should be a little bit familiar to you,

55
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.720
and basically this shows us

56
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.353
the names of the wireless networks around us.

57
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.460
So if I just go to my Mac machine

58
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.750
and look for wireless networks,

59
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.830
you'll see the same names that we see in here

60
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.093
displayed under the ESSID.

61
00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.920
Now all of the other columns show us more information

62
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.560
about the network name that you see in here,

63
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.980
and this information will actually be very useful to us

64
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.973
as we go through the course.

65
00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.630
The first column, the BSSID,

66
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.043
shows us the MAC address of the target network.

67
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.760
Next, we have the PwR.

68
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.350
So this is the signal strength, or the power,

69
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.483
of the network.

70
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.660
Now the higher the number, the better signal we have.

71
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.430
So for example, the network with the best signal right here

72
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.443
is this one.

73
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.690
Next, we have the beacons.

74
00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.520
These are frames, sent by the network

75
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.580
in order to broadcast it's existence.

76
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.510
So every network, even if it's set to be hidden,

77
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.360
always sends these type of frames,

78
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.320
basically broadcasting it's existence,

79
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.620
and telling all the wireless devices around it

80
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.497
that "I exist, I have this BSSID.

81
00:04:19.497 --> 00:04:22.797
"I work on this channel, I use this encryption,

82
00:04:22.797 --> 00:04:24.747
"and my name is this."

83
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.790
Next, we have the number of data packets, or data frames,

84
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.670
and these are the useful packets

85
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.810
that we'll talk about later on,

86
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.323
once we get to the cracking section.

87
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.480
This column represents the number of data packets

88
00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.323
that we collected in the past 10 seconds.

89
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.900
Next we have the channel,

90
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.190
which is the channel that the network works on.

91
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.540
So for example, this network right here, the Test AP,

92
00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.330
works on channel 6.

93
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.543
This network works on channel 1, and so on.

94
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.803
Next, we have the maximum speed supported by the network.

95
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.060
The encryption is a very important column,

96
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.610
and it shows us the encryption used by the network.

97
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.700
So we can see that the Test AP network is using WPA.

98
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.820
We can see we have a network that uses WEP.

99
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.450
We can see this network right here is an open network,

100
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:25.920
so it doesn't use encryption.

101
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.350
We don't even need a password to connect to it.

102
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.103
And we can see we have a WPA2 network right here.

103
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.270
CIPHER is the cipher used in the network.

104
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.370
So we can see here we have CCMP, we have WEP,

105
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.673
and we have CCMP again here.

106
00:05:45.612 --> 00:05:48.830
AUTH is the authentication used on that network,

107
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.730
and in here we can see it's PSK, Pre-Shared Key,

108
00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.640
and MGT for this network.

109
00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.440
Now don't worry about the ENC, the CIPHER and the AUTH.

110
00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.770
We will talk about breaking into all these networks,

111
00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.710
into WEP, WPA, and WPA2,

112
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.303
in the gaining access section.

113
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.050
And finally, you can see we have the ESSID section,

114
00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.170
which shows the name of the network.

115
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.090
So this is what you see when you look for networks

116
00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.563
in your network manager.

117
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.210
So that's it for this lecture.

118
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.260
I just wanted to give you a quick look

119
00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.980
on how to discover all the networks around us

120
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.183
using Airodump-NG.

121
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.700
Don't worry about Airodump-NG too much now.

122
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.790
We're gonna be using it a lot in the next lectures,

123
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.230
and you'll get very comfortable with using it

124
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.013
as we go through the course.
