00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.870
<v Narrator>In this lecture I'd like</v>

2
00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.800
to talk about WiFi Bands.

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.370
The band of a network

4
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.450
defines what frequency it

5
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.400
can use to broadcast the signal.

6
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.030
This means it also defines

7
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.930
the frequency that the clients

8
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.030
or the computers need to be able

9
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.150
to support and use in order to

10
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.680
be able to connect this network.

11
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.570
The two main frequencies used in

12
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.120
WiFi networks are 2.4 and 5 gigzhertz.

13
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.010
Now previously, when we use airodump-ng

14
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.970
we were only sniffing on

15
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.423
the 2.4 gigahertz frequency.

16
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.790
You can see first of all

17
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:38.795
my wireless adapter is in

18
00:00:38.795 --> 00:00:41.690
monitor mode mon0 in here.

19
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.190
So if I just do airodump-ng mon0

20
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.700
you'll see that I can get the

21
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.310
wireless networks around me.

22
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.620
But you might have noticed that

23
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.170
you won't actually see all the networks

24
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.633
around you when you run airodump-ng.

25
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.550
I'm gonna control-c this

26
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.370
and if I go here to

27
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.520
my normal host machine

28
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.530
and it actually has a

29
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:09.790
built in wireless adapter

30
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.925
so it's not as strong

31
00:01:11.925 --> 00:01:13.270
as my alpha adapter.

32
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.270
But if I look for networks,

33
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.540
you'll see I actually have

34
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.203
much more networks in here.

35
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.250
And mainly I have networks and

36
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.030
in here and the name by 5G.

37
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.410
Now the network doesn't have

38
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.570
to necessarily end in 5G

39
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.990
but here in Ireland if

40
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.750
a network broadcasts over five gigahertz

41
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.400
the service provider adds

42
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.370
5G to the network name.

43
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.950
But we also have other networks

44
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.540
broadcasting over 5G

45
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.710
that don't end in 5G.

46
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.400
But basically the main point that

47
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.660
I want to talk about is I'm not able

48
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.680
to see all the networks around me

49
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.690
in here in airodump-ng.

50
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.840
And the reason for this is

51
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.465
because airodump-ng is only sniffing

52
00:01:54.465 --> 00:01:57.760
on 2.0 gigahertz frequency.

53
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.370
So if you do this and you don't

54
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.340
see all the networks around you,

55
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.550
or if you're sniffing

56
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:04.707
on your own network,

57
00:02:04.707 --> 00:02:06.650
but you don't see all the clients

58
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.550
in your network it's possible

59
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.400
that your routers is

60
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.930
broadcasting over two bands,

61
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.470
over 2.4 and five gigahertz.

62
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.440
And if you're not seeing

63
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.380
the router at all,

64
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.640
if you are not seeing the network

65
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.440
at all like what's happening

66
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.930
here for me, then the router

67
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.580
is probably just broadcasting

68
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.560
over five gigahertz.

69
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.950
Now this doesn't mean that

70
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.970
your wireless adapter is not good.

71
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.360
it just literally means that

72
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.980
this adapter is not able to

73
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.720
see five gigahertz frequency.

74
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.640
It's just outside of its limit,

75
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.010
outside of its reach.

76
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.920
The main problem with five gigahertz

77
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.250
is that, there are a lot

78
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.750
of wireless adapters that can

79
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.960
see it and can communicate with it.

80
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.700
But not many of them support

81
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.060
monitor mode and packet injection.

82
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.330
So you might see me and other people

83
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.270
recommending wireless adapters like

84
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.340
Alpha AWUS0360NHA

85
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.920
This is my most favorite wireless adapter.

86
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.040
I use it all the time, even now.

87
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.780
But the problem with that adapter is

88
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.163
it doesn't pick up five gigahertz frequency.

89
00:03:07.356 --> 00:03:09.030
So it doesn't mean that that adapter is bad

90
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.560
it just means that it can't see

91
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.103
five gigahertz frequency.

92
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.190
Like I said, there aren't many

93
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.750
wireless adapters that support five gigahertz,

94
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.450
but I have an adapter here it's Alpha AWUS0360ACH

95
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.070
and this adapter supports both

96
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.790
2.4 gigahertz and five gigahertz frequencies.

97
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.200
It's not as good as the Alpha

98
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.520
but it does the job.

99
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.090
Now if you want more information about

100
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.260
wireless adapters check out

101
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.330
the link in the resources.

102
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.670
I'm not going to talk a lot about

103
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.930
what wireless adapters do.

104
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.760
But in this lecture I wanna show you

105
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.100
how to sniff and discover five gigahertz

106
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.060
frequency networks and then so that

107
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.850
you can use all the attacks that you've

108
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.292
learned in my other lecture and

109
00:03:52.292 --> 00:03:55.010
in my previous videos with

110
00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.713
five gigahertz networks.

111
00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.800
So, the adapter that I'm using right now

112
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.790
supports five gigahertz but

113
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.260
as you can see, I still

114
00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.300
can't pick up these networks.

115
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.410
That's because I need to specifically

116
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.730
tell airodump-ng that I want you

117
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.680
to listen on five gigahertz frequencies

118
00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.473
and five gigahertz channels.

119
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.260
To do that, all we have to do is

120
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.910
just do airodump-ng like we always do

121
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.160
and then we are gonna use a new argument

122
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.780
that we haven't see before and

123
00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.573
this argument is called band.

124
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.990
And we're gonna tell it that I want

125
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.550
you to sniff on band A

126
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:34.840
and that's the band that

127
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.680
supports five gigahertz frequency.

128
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.192
And then I'm just going to give it

129
00:04:39.192 --> 00:04:41.180
the name of my wireless adapter

130
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.473
in monitor mode which is Mon0.

131
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.340
So the command is very simple.

132
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.610
It's very similar to what

133
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.050
we have used before.

134
00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.060
And all we have to do

135
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.250
is just type in airodump-ng

136
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.013
followed by the band and

137
00:04:56.013 --> 00:04:58.760
that band that we want to use is A

138
00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.140
and we're following that with

139
00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.873
our wireless interface.

140
00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:04.713
So I'm gonna hit enter,

141
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:08.620
and as you can see as soon

142
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.870
as we hit this I'm actually just

143
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.490
gonna do control C now 'cause

144
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.490
you can see the results.

145
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.390
You can see that we got much more

146
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.720
networks right now and we have

147
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.130
the five gigahertz networks.

148
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.110
So we have this network and

149
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.980
this network that we

150
00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.590
weren't able to see.

151
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.150
We have the JamesSmithWhiskey

152
00:05:26.042 --> 00:05:26.875
newtwork as well.

153
00:05:26.875 --> 00:05:28.660
And basically we're able to capture

154
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.600
all the networks that use the

155
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.040
five gigahertz frequency.

156
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.850
Now what you can also do,

157
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.550
let me clear the screen.

158
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.860
You can specify multiple bands

159
00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.970
using the band argument.

160
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.920
So again, using the same command,

161
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.993
instead of just saying band A,

162
00:05:47.092 --> 00:05:49.208
we can do band a-b-g

163
00:05:49.208 --> 00:05:50.943
and what this will do is

164
00:05:50.943 --> 00:05:54.880
it will tell airodump-ng to capture data

165
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.820
on both 2.4 and five gigahertz frequencies

166
00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.073
at the same time.

167
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.423
So let me show you.

168
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.740
So as you can see right here

169
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.760
we're capturing some 2.4 gigahertz networks

170
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.950
and we're capturing five gigahertz networks

171
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.980
as well at the same time.

172
00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.960
and we'll also be able to discover

173
00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.840
clients connecting to both bands.

174
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.210
The only problem with using

175
00:06:22.299 --> 00:06:24.130
airodump like this is first of all,

176
00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.110
you need a powerful

177
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.250
wireless adapter to do this.

178
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.820
Also it will be slightly slower

179
00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.040
than only sniffing on one band.

180
00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.380
Because when you're sniffing on

181
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.260
two bands you have a lot of channels

182
00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.330
that airodump-ng has to hop on

183
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.840
all of them and discover clients

184
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.203
and networks broadcasting on these channels.

185
00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.140
So, if you want quicker results

186
00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.980
then you're better off specifying the band A,

187
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.400
when you want to sniff on the

188
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.570
five gigahertz frequencies and just

189
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.403
not specify the band when sniffing on 2.4.

190
00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.660
But, as you can see you can

191
00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.460
just run the command like so,

192
00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.470
with band a-b-g and this way you'll

193
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.203
be able to capture data sent over

194
00:07:06.203 --> 00:07:09.863
2.4 and five gigahertz frequencies.

195
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.290
Also keep in mind, in order to sniff data

196
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.400
on five gigahertz frequency, like I said

197
00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.740
your wireless adapter needs to

198
00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.200
be able to support this band.

199
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.690
So simply adding the band argument

200
00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.714
will not work unless your wireless adapter

201
00:07:27.714 --> 00:07:32.143
can support and can sniff data on this band.

202
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.180
One more thing that I wanna note,

203
00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:37.920
I've actually said this before.

204
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.220
If you run airodump-ng against a network

205
00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.530
and you see some devices missing

206
00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:46.260
then there is a high chance that these devices

207
00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.700
are connected over five gigahertz.

208
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.380
So again, use the band A and then

209
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.583
you should be able to see these devices.
