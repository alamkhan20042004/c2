00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.860
<v Instructor>So from the previous lecture,</v>

2
00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.870
we know, in order to crack WEP,

3
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.370
we need to first capture a large number of packets,

4
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.650
this means that we'll capture a large number of IVs,

5
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.970
the IVs, because they are short,

6
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.480
they will be repeated,

7
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.020
therefore we'll be able to use a tool called aircrack-ng

8
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.180
to run statistical attacks

9
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.453
and crack the WEP key.

10
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.330
So, we're using airodump-ng to capture the data

11
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.240
and we've seen how to do this before,

12
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.270
then we're using aircrack-ng

13
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.650
to analyze this data and break the key.

14
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.503
Let's see how to do this in practice.

15
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.270
So I already have my wireless adapter in monitor mode.

16
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.440
And it's called mon0.

17
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.010
I've also already run airodump-ng

18
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.450
to list all the networks around me

19
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.576
and as you can see, I have only one network using WEP.

20
00:00:53.576 --> 00:00:56.850
This is called Test AP3

21
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.360
and this is my actual network

22
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.850
that I use every day.

23
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.900
I've just configured it to use WEP

24
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.990
to make this lecture.

25
00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:07.100
The main reason why I'm targeting the network

26
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.560
that I use daily

27
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.030
because like I said, for this to work,

28
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.340
we need to capture a large number of packets

29
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.203
and therefore we need a busy network,

30
00:01:17.203 --> 00:01:19.630
a network that gets used constantly

31
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.430
to capture a large number of packets.

32
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.070
If the network is idle,

33
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.530
then the process is a little bit complex

34
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.260
and I will cover that in the next lecture.

35
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.120
So for now, let's focus on the simplest form

36
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.300
which is how to break into a busy network.

37
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.723
So I'm gonna copy the BSSID of this network.

38
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.340
And I'm gonna run airodump-ng against this network only.

39
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.620
So I showed you how to do this before.

40
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.010
I'm gonna do airodump.ng.

41
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.010
I'm gonna do --bssid to specify the BSSID of the network.

42
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.850
Then I'm gonna do --channel

43
00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.780
to specify the channel of the network

44
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.053
and we can see it's running on number one.

45
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.210
And I'm gonna do --write

46
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.830
to store everything that we capture into a file

47
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.423
and let's call this file basic_wep.

48
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.590
And then I'm gonna specify my wireless adapter

49
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.543
in monitor mode which is mon0.

50
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.250
So we ran this command before

51
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.260
in the targeted sniffing lecture.

52
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.890
All we're doing is we're running airodump.ng

53
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.940
against a specific network with this MAC address,

54
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.020
with this channel and we're storing everything in a file

55
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.557
called basic_wep.

56
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.190
I'm gonna hit Enter

57
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.930
and as you can see, airodump.ng is working

58
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.730
against my target network

59
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.660
and if you notice,

60
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.730
you'll see the data in here

61
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.240
is increasing really, really fast.

62
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.310
So this is something that I told you,

63
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.680
I'll talk about it later

64
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.410
when we were talking airodump.ng

65
00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.570
because I didn't want to talk about IVs

66
00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.410
at that early stage.

67
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.350
So basically what you see under the Data column

68
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.680
is the number of useful packets

69
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.100
that contain a different IV

70
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.490
that we can use in order to crack the key.

71
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.790
So the higher this number is,

72
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.020
the more likely we will be able

73
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.850
to crack the key.

74
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.420
As you can see, this number is increasing very fast

75
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.960
because like I said, this is a busy network

76
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.380
that is being used at the moment

77
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.860
by my own computers and my own devices.

78
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.170
If yours isn't increasing fast,

79
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.790
then don't worry, we will tackle this problem

80
00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.033
in the next lectures.

81
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.710
So for now, we're capturing a lot of data

82
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.430
and this should actually be enough

83
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.230
to crack the key.

84
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.600
So what I'm gonna do,

85
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.580
I'm gonna go down to my other terminal in here

86
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.030
and if we actually list the files,

87
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.370
you'll see that we have the capture file

88
00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.020
that we specified in the write argument

89
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.580
and like I said, we're always interested in the .cap file.

90
00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.600
So all we have to do right now

91
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.210
is do step two in here.

92
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.600
Run aircrack-ng against the file

93
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.903
that we captured in order to crack the key.

94
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.360
So I'm gonna do aircrack.ng

95
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.940
followed by the file name

96
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.973
which is basic_wep-01.cap.

97
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.723
I'm gonna hit Enter.

98
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.130
And as you can see,

99
00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.843
it's telling us that the key is found.

100
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.550
So let me cancel this here

101
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.370
and right now, we can connect

102
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.890
to the target network which is called Test_AP3

103
00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.730
using this ASCII password,

104
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.700
so you can literally just copy this and paste it

105
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.403
or you can connect using this key.

106
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.790
Now, in some cases,

107
00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.630
you will not see this ASCII password.

108
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.830
That's why I'm gonna show you how to connect

109
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.310
using this key right here

110
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.033
because you'll always get this.

111
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.813
So I'm gonna copy this.

112
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.550
And I'm just gonna paste it here.

113
00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.090
You can paste it anywhere in a normal text editor

114
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.880
or anywhere you want.

115
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.200
And all you have to do

116
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.970
is remove the colons

117
00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.513
that we see in here between the numbers.

118
00:05:08.781 --> 00:05:10.333
So I'm gonna remove this one,

119
00:05:11.446 --> 00:05:12.910
I'm gonna remove this one,

120
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.500
this one and this.

121
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.713
And now, we can just copy this.

122
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.260
And just to show you,

123
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.630
I'm actually gonna connect from my host machine.

124
00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.310
You can connect from Kali

125
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.480
but when we enabled monitor mode,

126
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.440
we killed a lot of processes

127
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.705
and sometimes even after you restart these processes,

128
00:05:32.705 --> 00:05:34.700
getting connecting to your target

129
00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.230
will be a little bit buggy

130
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.620
so it's best to literally just restart Kali

131
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.030
and connect again.

132
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.840
So just to save all of this time,

133
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.040
I'm going to connect from here.

134
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.040
I'm just gonna click here,

135
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.430
I'm gonna connect to Test AP3.

136
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.983
And I'm going to paste the password.

137
00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.960
So I'm just gonna click on Show the Password

138
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:56.950
to show it to you.

139
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.280
Again, the same password,

140
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.240
we just remove the colons.

141
00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.420
I'm gonna click on Join.

142
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.742
And as you can see, we managed to connect

143
00:06:04.742 --> 00:06:07.300
and we can test this connection

144
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.010
by going to Google and perfect.

145
00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.840
As you can see, it's working

146
00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.853
and we managed to break the WEP encryption.
