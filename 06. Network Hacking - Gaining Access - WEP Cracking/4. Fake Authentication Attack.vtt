00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.070
<v Instructor>In the previous lecture,</v>

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.373
we've seen how easy it is to crack WEP.

3
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.410
All we had to do is capture enough data

4
00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.000
and then run aircrack-ng to crack the encryption

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.343
and give me the key.

6
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.000
Now, one problem that we could face

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.220
is if the network is not busy.

8
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.520
If it's not busy,

9
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.190
then the number of data

10
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.980
will be increasing very, very slowly.

11
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.940
Therefore, we're gonna have to wait

12
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.110
for a while before we have enough data

13
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.423
to crack the key.

14
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.160
So let me show you an example.

15
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.320
I'm just gonna run airodump-ng here

16
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.751
and list all the networks around me.

17
00:00:40.751 --> 00:00:43.950
And you can see I have my test network,

18
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.455
my Test AP in here, it's using WEP.

19
00:00:47.455 --> 00:00:49.590
And if you look under the Data,

20
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.720
you'll see that it's at zero

21
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.320
and it's not increasing

22
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.150
and even if it's gonna increase,

23
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.110
it's gonna increase very, very slowly

24
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.060
which means that I'm gonna have to be waiting

25
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.543
for hours before I can crack this network.

26
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.670
So a solution to this

27
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.670
is to force the AP to generate new packets with new IVs.

28
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.610
Now, before doing this,

29
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.400
we need to associate with this network.

30
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.100
So what I mean by associate

31
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.990
is we need to tell this network

32
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.770
that we want to communicate with it

33
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.480
because by default,

34
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.440
access points ignore any requests they get

35
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.140
unless the device has connected to this network

36
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.410
or associated with it.

37
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.180
So don't get this mixed up with connecting.

38
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.050
We're still unable to connect to the network

39
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.990
because we need the password to be able to connect

40
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.100
to the network

41
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.020
but what we're doing right now

42
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.270
is literally just telling the target network look,

43
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.340
I want to communicate with you.

44
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.260
Don't ignore my requests.

45
00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.623
That's all we're doing.

46
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.740
So it's something similar to what happens

47
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.100
when you just click on the network when you want

48
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.250
to connect to it.

49
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.190
You still haven't put the password,

50
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.160
you just telling the target network

51
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.230
I want to communicate with you,

52
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.973
please don't ignore me.

53
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.710
So in this lecture, I'm gonna show you

54
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.550
how to associate with the target network

55
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.600
so we can communicate with it

56
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.440
and in the next lecture,

57
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.770
I'm gonna show you how once associated,

58
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.000
we can inject packets into the network

59
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.843
and force the number of data to increase very, very quickly.

60
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.870
First, I'm going to run airodump.ng

61
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.480
against my target network

62
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.760
which has this BSSID.

63
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.670
So I'm gonna copy it

64
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.970
and we're gonna use the exact same command

65
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.750
that we've been using so far.

66
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.630
So we're gonna do airodump.ng --bssid

67
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.260
followed by the MAC address of my target --channel

68
00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.870
followed by the channel

69
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.340
which my target is running on which is six

70
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.040
and we're gonna store all of this.

71
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.360
So we're gonna do --write

72
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.450
and we'll call this file arpreplay

73
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.680
because that's the name of the attack.

74
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.100
And then I'm gonna put my wireless adapter

75
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.583
in monitor mode which is mon0.

76
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.330
So a very simple command that we've done before.

77
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.380
We're using airodump.ng to capture data

78
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.730
from a network with this MAC address,

79
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.280
running on this channel,

80
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.797
we're storing everything in a file called arpreplay.

81
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.910
I'm gonna hit Enter

82
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.270
and as you can see, it's running against my target

83
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.530
and notice the data is increasing really, really slow

84
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.293
or it's actually not increasing at all right now.

85
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.020
Now, to associate with this network,

86
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.903
we're going to use a program called aireplay-ng.

87
00:03:54.997 --> 00:03:58.490
So we're gonna type aireplay-ng

88
00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.000
followed by --fakeauth

89
00:04:01.524 --> 00:04:02.757
because we want to do a fake authentication attack.

90
00:04:05.225 --> 00:04:07.040
We're gonna put zero

91
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.760
because we only want to do this once.

92
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.190
We're gonna do -a to specify the MAC address

93
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.770
of the target network.

94
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.920
So I'm gonna paste it, I've already copied it.

95
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.900
Then we're gonna do -h

96
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.223
to specify the MAC address of my wireless adapter

97
00:04:24.223 --> 00:04:27.940
and to get the MAC address of my wireless adapter,

98
00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.593
I'm gonna do ifconfig.

99
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.540
And it's the first 12 digits of the unspec field.

100
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.300
Usually you'd see it after the ether

101
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.350
but when you enable monitor mode,

102
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.953
it'll show up like so.

103
00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.763
So I'm gonna copy this.

104
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.003
And I'm gonna paste it here.

105
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.383
And I'm gonna replace the minuses with colons.

106
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.830
And that's it, it's done.

107
00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.430
And finally, I'm just gonna give the name

108
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.473
of my wireless adapter in monitor mode.

109
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.560
So a very simple command.

110
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.150
We're using aireplay-ng

111
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.940
which is a tool that can be used

112
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.540
to run a number of attacks

113
00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.763
and we've seen using this with the de-authentication attack.

114
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:16.910
We're telling it that we want

115
00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.810
to run a fake authentication attack.

116
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.900
We wanna do this once.

117
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.890
We're giving it the MAC address of my target network

118
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.670
after the a.

119
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.410
Then I'm giving it the MAC address of my wireless adapter

120
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:32.580
after the h

121
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.110
an finally, I'm giving it my wireless adapter

122
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.283
in monitor mode.

123
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.910
Now before I run this,

124
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.320
notice in here under the AUTH, we have nothing.

125
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.890
And we don't have any clients showing up in here

126
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:46.763
at the bottom.

127
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.397
Now, if I hit Enter,

128
00:05:49.397 --> 00:05:52.280
you can see under the AUTH,

129
00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.580
it's showing up as OPN

130
00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.080
and you can see we have a new client here associated

131
00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.083
with the network.

132
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.460
If you look in here,

133
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.750
you'll see this is the MAC address of my target network

134
00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.990
and right here is the MAC address

135
00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.800
of my wireless adapter.

136
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.320
So right now, I am associated with the target network

137
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.360
and if I send it anything,

138
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.130
it's going to accept it

139
00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.610
and it's gonna communicate with me.

140
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.010
Again, I am not connected to the network,

141
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:23.860
I still can't use the internet,

142
00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.900
I'm literally just associated with the network

143
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.103
so I can communicate with it.

144
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:31.890
Now, in the next lecture,

145
00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.650
I'm gonna show you how we can communicate

146
00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.620
with this network in a way

147
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.880
to force it into generating new packets

148
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.340
with new IVs which will allow us

149
00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.003
to crack the key very, very quickly.
