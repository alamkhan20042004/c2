1
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.690
<v ->Now you have enough information</v>

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.510
to go ahead and try to gain access

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:07.660
to other systems.

4
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.660
To computers, servers,

5
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.270
web servers and stuff like that.

6
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.490
And in this section

7
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.020
we're gonna be talking about

8
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.603
gaining access to computer devices.

9
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.500
And what I mean by computer devices

10
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.050
is anything

11
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.630
and the reason behind this,

12
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.570
I wanna get this through,

13
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.160
I wanna get this idea through,

14
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.870
is that any electronic device you see

15
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:31.940
is a computer.

16
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.900
So a phone, a TV,

17
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.740
a laptop, a web server,

18
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:36.870
a website

19
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.720
a network, a router,

20
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.000
all of these things are computers.

21
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.950
All of them have an operating system

22
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.140
and they have programs installed

23
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.130
on these operating systems.

24
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.300
And usually,

25
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.420
in most cases,

26
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.540
these computers are used by a user.

27
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.060
So you have an operating system,

28
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.790
they have programs installed

29
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.200
on that operating system

30
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.270
and they have a user

31
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.030
who uses and configures this system.

32
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.550
So, I'm gonna be talking about

33
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.640
how you gain access to computers

34
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.710
in this example

35
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.430
and actual personal computers

36
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.440
so the name that people call it usually.

37
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.680
A computer,

38
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.513
so it's gonna be,

39
00:01:12.513 --> 00:01:13.370
we're gonna have a target

40
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.600
of a Windows device

41
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.600
and we're gonna have a target

42
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.403
of a Linux device.

43
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.310
But the concept is always the same.

44
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.410
Getting access to computer devices

45
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.280
is always the same.

46
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.390
So you can apply the same concepts

47
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.780
if you are targeting a phone,

48
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.900
if you are targeting a tablet,

49
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.280
if you're targeting a web server

50
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.230
and we will be targeting

51
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.650
web servers as well.

52
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.000
But I will be talking about it

53
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.680
just like a normal computer.

54
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.920
This is very important to understand.

55
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.280
Every device you see

56
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.360
is a computer

57
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.510
and it works just like your personal computer.

58
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.940
So I can set up a web server

59
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.010
on my computer.

60
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.680
I can make it look like a website

61
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.890
and make it act as a website,

62
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.730
I can make it act as a TV

63
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.230
and I can make it act as anything I want

64
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.180
and literally TV's and all these things

65
00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.980
are just simpler computers

66
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.833
with less complicated hardware in them.

67
00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.310
So, we're gonna be talking about

68
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.000
attacking these devices

69
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.860
from two main parts

70
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.320
or from two main sides.

71
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.550
The first approach

72
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:14.580
that we're going to use

73
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.720
is the server side.

74
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.960
So in this side

75
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.160
it doesn't require any user interaction.

76
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.790
We're gonna have a computer

77
00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.670
and we're gonna see how we can

78
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.620
gain access to that computer

79
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.480
without the need

80
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.020
for the user to do anything.

81
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.990
For the user who uses that computer

82
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.330
to do anything.

83
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.820
This mostly applies to web servers

84
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.620
and applications

85
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.530
and devices

86
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.670
that don't get used much by people.

87
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.950
So people basically configure them

88
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.470
and then they run automatically.

89
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.060
So, all we have is gonna be an IP address

90
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.620
and we're gonna see how we can test

91
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.620
the security

92
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.200
and gain access to that computer

93
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.670
based on that IP.

94
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.490
So, our main way of getting in

95
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.200
is gonna be the operating system

96
00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.410
that that runs

97
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.942
and the applications installed

98
00:03:00.942 --> 00:03:02.343
on that system.

99
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.520
The second approach that we're gonna try

100
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.200
is the client side attacks.

101
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.250
So this approach will require

102
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.810
the client or the person

103
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.140
who uses that computer

104
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.480
to do something.

105
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.313
To do something

106
00:03:14.313 --> 00:03:15.267
that something could be

107
00:03:15.267 --> 00:03:16.480
a number of things.

108
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.040
It could be installing an update,

109
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.630
it could be opening a picture,

110
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.670
it could be opening a Trojan,

111
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.503
so we're gonna learn

112
00:03:22.503 --> 00:03:23.460
how to create a Trojan,

113
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.860
how to create Backdoors,

114
00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.060
how to use social engineering

115
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.580
to make the target person

116
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.600
do something

117
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.530
and when they do that action,

118
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.803
we will gain access to their computer.

119
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:37.350
Information gatherings

120
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.650
can be crucial in this case

121
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.460
because we actually need to know

122
00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.143
the person that we're targeting.

123
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:44.410
After all of that,

124
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.770
I'm gonna talk about

125
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.300
the post exploitation.

126
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.710
So what you could do

127
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.720
after you gain access to this computer,

128
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.110
regardless of the method

129
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.590
that you gained access to it.

130
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.940
So you could have used a server side exploit,

131
00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:56.950
you could have used

132
00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.330
a client side exploit

133
00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:59.163
or you could have

134
00:03:59.163 --> 00:04:00.560
just got physical access.

135
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.630
The person left their desk

136
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:02.600
and you got in.

137
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.590
So, we're gonna see how you could,

138
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.600
what can you do

139
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.320
once you have access to your target.

140
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.550
How you could further exploit that target

141
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.150
and increase your privileges

142
00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.483
or target other computers in the same place.
