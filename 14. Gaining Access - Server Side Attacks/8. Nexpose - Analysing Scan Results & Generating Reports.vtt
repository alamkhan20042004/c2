1
00:00:01.265 --> 00:00:03.440
<v Instructor>Okay, my scan is over.</v>

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.803
And I'm here now at the assets page.

3
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.083
And as you can see that we have one asset.

4
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.840
Has been scanned.

5
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.665
We can see that the asset is running Ubuntu

6
00:00:15.665 --> 00:00:17.620
and the skills that you need

7
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.353
to hack into this asset is novice.

8
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.250
Now already from this you can see that Nexpose

9
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.280
show us much more information than Metasploit Community,

10
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.110
and it's a much more advanced

11
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.820
vulnerability management framework.

12
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.600
We can see that we scanned one target,

13
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.810
it's Metasploitable, and the site is Global.

14
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.420
Let me zoom in.

15
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.763
It's running on Ubuntu Linux 8.04.

16
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.100
We discovered no malware and 177 exploits,

17
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.610
308 vulnerabilities.

18
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.340
Remember with Metasploit Community,

19
00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.500
I think we only only discovered eight,

20
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.580
only one exploitable vulnerability,

21
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.630
and eight modules that can be used.

22
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.410
Here we discovered 308 vulnerabilities,

23
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.153
so it's covered so many more vulnerabilities and exploits.

24
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.750
You can see that there is a risk factor assessed to this

25
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.763
and the last time that the scan was done.

26
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.360
Now if we go down we can see that the operating system

27
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.880
that we discovered again, it's Metasploit.

28
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.630
We can see the software that is installed

29
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.750
on the target computer.

30
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.730
So not only the services that's running on ports,

31
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.400
we can see actual software installed on the target computer.

32
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.270
This can be very useful after we have the computer,

33
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.190
so after we've managed to hack into it,

34
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.410
it's very useful to find local exploits

35
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.140
that can be used to increase our privileges,

36
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.230
for example, if you got a normal user

37
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.650
and you wanted to become a route, then you can use

38
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.150
a local buffer overflow to increase your privileges

39
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.770
or to do other kind of stuff.

40
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.763
So these are very useful in terms of post-exploitation.

41
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.280
If we go down, we'll see the services that's installed

42
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.800
on the target computer.

43
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.370
Just like UNMAP gave it to us,

44
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.250
we can see that HTTPs running,

45
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.073
DNS, and so on.

46
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.140
If you click on any of these services,

47
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.700
you'll see that it'll give you more information about it,

48
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.400
for example it's a HTTP service, a description about it

49
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.350
and the ports that it's running on.

50
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.530
So we can see that HTTPs running on port 80,

51
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.243
and on port 8180.

52
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.300
Now let's go up.

53
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.010
And if we wanted to have a closer look

54
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.880
on the vulnerabilities,

55
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.623
we can go to the vulnerabilities page here.

56
00:02:49.495 --> 00:02:51.400
And you can see we have a graph here

57
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.260
about the vulnerabilities,

58
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.310
categorized based on their risk factor.

59
00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.160
And here they're categorized based on the skill level

60
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.653
needed in order to exploit these vulnerabilities.

61
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.430
And in here you can see a list of all of them

62
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.653
and we can switch between them using this right here.

63
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.950
Again, this, if there is any malware,

64
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.470
you'll see it in here.

65
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.380
And if there is an exploitation you'll see it in here.

66
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.150
Now all of these top vulnerabilities here

67
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.860
don't have an exploitation using their tool

68
00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.960
but they are ordered based on their risk.

69
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.770
So these are very risky vulnerabilities

70
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.380
and then as we proceed through them,

71
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.283
the risk will be a bit less.

72
00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.300
So you can see here I discovered that VNC password

73
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.470
is 'password', so we can go in and try to connect using VNC.

74
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.830
Now VNC is a service very similar to Remote Desktop,

75
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.040
basically it'll show you the desktop

76
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.360
and it'll allow you to gain full access

77
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.230
to the target computer, just like Remote Desktop.

78
00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.570
I'm not gonna show you how to do that, very simple.

79
00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.710
Was telling you here, the password is 'password',

80
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.580
now it's also telling you that there is a backdoor running

81
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.540
and we used that already.

82
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.170
It's telling us that it's running an old version of PHP

83
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.930
that can be exploitable, just an old version actually.

84
00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.410
Now let's look at something that can be exploitable.

85
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.120
So I'm gonna click on this to order them by the exploit,

86
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.910
and you can see that all of these have an 'M' logo,

87
00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.710
which means that they can be exploited using Metasploit.

88
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.110
You can see here we have the remote shell service

89
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.890
that we use, and there is the rlogin service here

90
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.380
that can be used as well, that we already had a look on.

91
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.180
So let's click on something that we haven't seen before.

92
00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.563
And here you can see a description of this vulnerability.

93
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.580
Again, you can see the port that it's running on.

94
00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.730
And you can see why it thinks that this particular target

95
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.713
is vulnerable to this exploit.

96
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.500
If you go down, it'll show you how you can exploit it.

97
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.290
So there's three different modules

98
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.683
that can be used to exploit it.

99
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.390
But it doesn't really have to exploit it,

100
00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.800
sometimes you just see modules that can be used

101
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.700
to verify the existence of this exploit.

102
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.530
But basically these are modules associated with it.

103
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.170
And if we click on this it'll take us to the Rapid7 page

104
00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.810
that we always use to see when we Google stuff.

105
00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.510
And we see the module name where we can just copy

106
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.460
and paste it in Metasploit and it shows the options

107
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.370
and then use this exploit the same way that we seeing it

108
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:31.543
in previous videos.

109
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.070
Again when you go down, you'll see references to this,

110
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.723
to this particular exploit.

111
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.600
And at the bottom it'll show you the solution

112
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.490
on how you can fix this exploit.

113
00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.430
So for this one, all you need to do

114
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.140
is just change the administrator password

115
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.693
and not use the default configuration.

116
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.910
Another useful thing is the reports.

117
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.981
So this framework allow you to generate reports

118
00:06:02.981 --> 00:06:05.540
for each scan that you do.

119
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.350
And there is different types of templates for the reports

120
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.380
so if you go on Create Report,

121
00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.940
you can see that there is an audit report

122
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.180
that contains a lot of information, detailed information

123
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.780
for the programmers or for the technical people.

124
00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.000
Or you can use an executive report

125
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.370
which has less information and it's made for the managers

126
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.430
or for the top level people that don't have much experience

127
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.050
with technical stuff.

128
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.180
You can select any template you want, call it anything,

129
00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.980
so I'm gonna call this 'Metasploitable' or 'Metasploit'.

130
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.360
And you select the format that you want,

131
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.360
so it's set to PDF here.

132
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.870
Then I'm going to select the target scan

133
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.670
that I want to generate the report for,

134
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:51.320
and I selected my Metasploitable.

135
00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.100
And then you save, and run the report,

136
00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.543
to generate the report.

137
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.410
You can also get this to generate reports automatically

138
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.180
every time, 'cause as I showed you,

139
00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.090
you can schedule reports, you can schedule scans,

140
00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.070
and you can also schedule an automatic report

141
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:11.720
after each time a scan is done.

142
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.100
So for example, if you're scanning every week,

143
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.570
you can also generate a report every week,

144
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.760
every time that scans done.

145
00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.110
Now let me just download the report and show you

146
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:22.180
what it looks like.

147
00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.190
As you can see it has the date, it has the title,

148
00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:28.200
it has all the exploits that have been found.

149
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.440
But this is the executive report so it has small details

150
00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.120
about the exploits and more graphical stuff

151
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.883
to show the executives the risks that has been found

152
00:07:36.883 --> 00:07:38.923
and how critical they are.

153
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.870
So as you can see, Nexpose shows you much more detail

154
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.570
and it's much more advanced.

155
00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:47.970
It's directed towards bigger companies,

156
00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:51.360
bigger infrastructures, where you need to always make sure

157
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.034
everything is up to date, and everything is installed,

158
00:07:54.034 --> 00:07:56.313
and does not have any exploits.
