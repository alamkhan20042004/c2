00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.780
<v ->So the first thing we're gonna look at</v>

2
00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.070
is the server side attacks.

3
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.550
And again, these are the attacks

4
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.120
that don't require user interaction.

5
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.520
You can use these attacks with servers, so web servers

6
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.520
and stuff like that.

7
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.860
And you can also use it against normal computers

8
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.263
that people use every day.

9
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.030
The reason why I'm gonna be using it

10
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.440
against my metasploitable,

11
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.180
which runs Unix and which is more of a server

12
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.250
than a normal personal computer,

13
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.340
is because if your target uses a personal computer,

14
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.350
and if they're not on the same network as you,

15
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.690
then even if you get their IP address,

16
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.970
their IP address is gonna be behind the router,

17
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.410
so they'll probably be connecting behind, through a router.

18
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.600
And therefore, if you use the IP to try and determine

19
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.190
what operating systems run on it and what applications

20
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.750
are installed, you will not get much useful information

21
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.380
because you're only gonna be getting information

22
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.450
about the router and not about the person,

23
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.670
because the person is hiding behind the router.

24
00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.850
Whereas, when you're targeting a web server

25
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.565
or a server in general, then the server will have

26
00:01:04.565 --> 00:01:06.810
an IP address and that IP address,

27
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.963
you can access it directly on the internet.

28
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.740
So, these ways of gathering information

29
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.710
that we're gonna look at now will work

30
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.510
if the person is on the same network and if the person

31
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.740
has a real IP.

32
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.110
So if you can ping the person,

33
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.550
even if it's a personal computer, if you can ping it,

34
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.220
then you can run all of the attacks

35
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.870
and all of the information gathering methods

36
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.810
that we're gonna explain now.

37
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.030
In my example, I'm gonna be targeting

38
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.690
my metasploitable machine here.

39
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.003
So, if I do IP config, or if I do ifconfig,

40
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.220
you'll see that my IP is 10.20.14.204.

41
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.000
And if I go to my caddy machine,

42
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.490
I should be able to ping it.

43
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.810
Now if I can't ping it,

44
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.660
then we won't be able to do anything.

45
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.040
And as you can see,

46
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.620
we're getting responses back from the machine.

47
00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.890
Therefore, we can try and test it security.

48
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.110
So again, you can use these attacks

49
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.630
and you can use these approaches

50
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.570
against any computer that you can ping.

51
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.550
So if it's a personal computer or if it's a server

52
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.880
of any kind, as long as you can ping that direction,

53
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.230
or you can ping that person, then you can use these attacks

54
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.230
and these methods that we're gonna talk about

55
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.360
in the server side attacks.

56
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.940
So it's gonna work against websites, web servers, people,

57
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.790
normal computers, as long as you can ping them.

58
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.560
And just to convey this idea,

59
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.000
now, we see the metasploitable machine right there.

60
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.220
So it's just a normal machine.

61
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.030
It's a normal virtual machine that I can use right here

62
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.240
to do anything I want.

63
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.120
I can list, I can even install a graphical interface,

64
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.770
and then I'll be able to do, just use it

65
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.100
just the way I use my (unintelligible) machine.

66
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.970
But at the same time, it has a web server.

67
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.713
So if I try to navigate to it from here,

68
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.380
you'll see that I actually have a web server here,

69
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.620
and it has websites that I can actually read and stuff,

70
00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.110
and browse, but we're actually gonna have a look

71
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.270
on these websites and see we can pentest them

72
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.430
in the future.

73
00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.320
So, everything is a computer.

74
00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.720
If you can ping that IP,

75
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.470
you can use the server side attacks.

76
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.000
It mostly works against servers

77
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.050
because servers always have real IP's.

78
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.990
And also, if the person is in the same network as you,

79
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.040
then you can ping them

80
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.143
and you can do all of these attacks as well.
