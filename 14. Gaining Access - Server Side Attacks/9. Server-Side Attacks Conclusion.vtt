00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.220
<v Speaker>In the previous lectures,</v>

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.530
we learned the basic methodology of server side attacks.

3
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.080
So we learned the basic methodology of how

4
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.760
to test the security of servers.

5
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.320
We learned how to do that manually

6
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.350
and then we learned how to do it with Nexspose using tools.

7
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.450
So before moving to the next section,

8
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.300
which is the client side attacks,

9
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.170
I want to spend one more lecture

10
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.490
just reflecting over everything that we've done so far

11
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.220
and just going over the steps that we used in order

12
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.650
to discover and exploit vulnerabilities in servers,

13
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.230
because testing the security of servers

14
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.390
or running servers side attacks is more

15
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.630
or less always the same.

16
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.420
Let me show you what I mean.

17
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.750
So we're always gonna have to start

18
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.010
by discovering information about our targets,

19
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.827
and we're gonna do that by discovering the open ports

20
00:00:51.827 --> 00:00:53.390
and the running services

21
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.030
and we're gonna do that using Nmap as we showed earlier.

22
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.400
Then once we have a list of all of the servers

23
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.950
and the running services as we can see in here,

24
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.280
for each one of these entries,

25
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.030
so for each one of these ports

26
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.200
and for each one of these services,

27
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.260
we're gonna go ahead and search for vulnerabilities

28
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.090
and we're gonna do that using Google

29
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.740
and using websites such as Exploit DB, and so on.

30
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.450
We're gonna look for vulnerabilities in the services.

31
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.600
If we do find vulnerabilities,

32
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.000
we're gonna see if they are exploitable

33
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.530
cause sometimes the exploitation might not be public

34
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.730
and if it is, we're gonna try to exploit it

35
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.030
or verify this vulnerability, and once done,

36
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.540
we're gonna write a note of it in our report

37
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.840
and we will talk about Pen Test reports

38
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.640
at the end of the course.

39
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.200
So as you can see, the steps are always the same.

40
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.030
You're always gonna use Nmap to discover the open ports

41
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.750
on the running services, you're always gonna look

42
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.850
for vulnerabilities in each one

43
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.960
of these services using Google

44
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.520
or other vulnerability websites like Exploit DB.

45
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.930
The only difference is,

46
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.930
is going to be finding and verifying these exploits

47
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.340
because using them could be slightly different

48
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.810
as we've seen previously and a lot of the time

49
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.050
when you find vulnerabilities that are not available

50
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.840
in Metasploit and so on,

51
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.760
the exploit itself will include documentation on how

52
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.900
to use it and if you can find it again,

53
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.010
you can look for it on Google and learn how to exploit it.

54
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.570
So although it looks very simple,

55
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.000
this is really always gonna be the methodology that we use

56
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.630
when approaching server side attacks

57
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.710
and this will always be the basic steps you'll use in CTF's,

58
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.590
such as Hack The Box and Try Hakimi.

59
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.630
You'll always start with an Nmap scan,

60
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.250
you'll always gonna try to discover vulnerabilities,

61
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.490
search for them, try to exploit them,

62
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.780
and verify your findings.

63
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.300
So although it sounds very simple,

64
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.960
I just wanted to make one more lecture,

65
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.320
just so that you know and so that it's clear

66
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.280
that it's really as simple as this

67
00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.220
and the only things

68
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.120
that could be different are the exploits themselves,

69
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.740
which you might have to do a bit of research

70
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.670
to learn how to exploit them, but there is no way for me

71
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.650
to cover all possible exploits,

72
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.890
there is literally thousands and thousands of exploits.

73
00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.250
What I'm trying to do here is just teach you how

74
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.600
to actually search for exploits and exploit them yourself

75
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.310
or search for information and apply it to yourself

76
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.800
and give you the basic proper methodology

77
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.423
of how to approach server side attacks.

78
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.720
Now, if you go throughout the whole list of the ports

79
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.660
and services that you discovered,

80
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.910
and you could not discover any exploitable vulnerabilities,

81
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.210
then the only hope

82
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.660
for you is to actually try client side attacks

83
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.703
and this is what we're gonna cover in the next section.
