1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.240
<v ->Okay, now that we installed Nexpose successfully,</v>

2
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.500
let's see how we can run that tool

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.640
and see what that tool is.

4
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.070
I know we spoke about it a lot

5
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.770
and we went through the installation process,

6
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.060
but you still haven't seen what the tool does.

7
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.690
So this is the homepage of the tool.

8
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.190
And, as you can see now, everything is empty.

9
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.430
So, before I start talking about what everything means,

10
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.500
let's go ahead and add the target

11
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.460
and then we'll do a test and we'll see,

12
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.210
'cause this stuff will be filled after we do a test.

13
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.830
So the first thing I'm gonna do is go on Create

14
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.910
and go on Site to add the target.

15
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.413
And I'm gonna call this target "metaesploitable",

16
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.840
and I'm going to go to the assets

17
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.640
and we're gonna add the target.

18
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.240
So the target can be arranged the same way we added it

19
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.740
when we were doing the network penetration part

20
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.660
of the things with Zenmap.

21
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.680
So you can add the range or you can add a specific IP.

22
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.510
So in this, we're actually targeting

23
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.150
the Metasploitable machine.

24
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.700
So we're going to add our target,

25
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.710
which is 10, 20, 14, 2, 0, 4.

26
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.510
Confirm this here. This is our Metasploitable machine,

27
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.083
10, 20, 14, 2, 0, 4.

28
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.340
And we're gonna add this to a group

29
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.387
and we call that "metasploitable" as well.

30
00:01:22.387 --> 00:01:24.817
And we call this "test".

31
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.163
So this is our group name.

32
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.870
Now, here in the authentication part,

33
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.520
if the target uses some sort of authentication,

34
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.360
so nobody can access the target,

35
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.040
unless they need to authenticate

36
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.350
with some sort of a service.

37
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.700
For example, if it's an FTP service

38
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.940
or a web http authentication,

39
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.943
a TELNET or an SQL server.

40
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.310
So you can pick it from here,

41
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.330
put the domain, username, password, confirm your password.

42
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.230
And that way the framework would be able to authenticate

43
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.730
with that service and test the security of your server.

44
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.380
Now, our server doesn't use any type of authentication,

45
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.623
so we don't need this.

46
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.680
Also, if you're targeting a web application

47
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.290
and the web application has a login page, for example,

48
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.250
for users, for example, Facebook.

49
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.950
Let's say you're targeting Facebook.

50
00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.960
Then you won't have access to most of Facebook's features

51
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.010
unless you log in with using a certain username

52
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.000
and a password.

53
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.750
So again, using this feature here,

54
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.593
you can log in and then test the security of your target.

55
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.510
And the Templates is, where you select the scan type.

56
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.960
So it's very similar to the scan type with Zenmap.

57
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.470
We've seen in Zenmap, we had a quick scan,

58
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.740
quick scan plus, and intense scan. This is the same.

59
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.420
So each one of these profiles is different.

60
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.700
It scans different things.

61
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.290
For example, we have the full audit here,

62
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.820
which takes a lot of time,

63
00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.570
but pretty much checks for everything.

64
00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.290
Then you have a full audit enhanced logging

65
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.410
without Web Spider.

66
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.640
So a Web Spider is a tool or a script

67
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.413
that finds all the files and directories in your target.

68
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.980
And the default one is a full audit without Web Spider.

69
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.560
So that's the one we're gonna be doing.

70
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.520
And you also have network specific profiles.

71
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.430
You have web audits as well.

72
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.030
So I really encourage you to try all of them or most of them

73
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.780
and get yourself familiar with them.

74
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.180
Now we're only gonna try this one

75
00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.110
because using them is the same.

76
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.110
Which will be scanning for ICMP, TCP and UDP ports.

77
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.260
So I'm leaving that the same.

78
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.320
I'm gonna leave the engine the same as well,

79
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.830
which means it's going to use our local engine,

80
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.870
which we installed instead of using

81
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.653
the one that is provided by Rapid7.

82
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.220
And the alerts, you can set up custom alerts.

83
00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.580
So that's when a vulnerability is found,

84
00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.730
you get a notification.

85
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.470
And the schedule is a really, really cool feature.

86
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.640
Now, say you're working for a company or for an enterprise

87
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.280
that keeps pushing code, new code every day.

88
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.370
Or for example, maybe your code,

89
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.110
you do a test today

90
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.190
and everything you're working on is good.

91
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.370
Your web servers, your programs, your applications.

92
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.430
Everything is up to date

93
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.310
and there's no vulnerabilities in them.

94
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.810
Let's say tomorrow you push a new vulnerable code,

95
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.600
or maybe tomorrow someone discovers a new vulnerability

96
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.370
with a program that you're using on your web server.

97
00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.630
So you're not secure anymore.

98
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.540
So this feature allows you to schedule this test

99
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.250
so that it runs every week or every hour or every month,

100
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.573
depending on how critical it is.

101
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.530
So all you have to do is just go into create a schedule

102
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:50.660
and create the schedule,

103
00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.220
so you can put a start date and an end date,

104
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.460
and you set up the frequency from here,

105
00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.150
for every day, every Thursday, every 26th,

106
00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.633
or depending on what you want, really.

107
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.420
You create a schedule and then every interval

108
00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.190
that you specify, the scan will run.

109
00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.860
And even you can get it to produce a report for you.

110
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.540
So you can go over the report and see what's changed

111
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:13.940
or what has been discovered.

112
00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.150
So everything's good, now.

113
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.790
The most important part today,

114
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.823
or what we did here is you put your target here.

115
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.440
And the next thing is you select the template.

116
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.030
So we have both of them selected,

117
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.330
and we're gonna do save and scan,

118
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.483
which will save this configuration and start a scan for us.

119
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.780
Now, as you can see, our asset discovery is in progress.

120
00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.230
I'm gonna pause the video.

121
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:41.600
And after that,

122
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.073
we will talk about the results that we got.
