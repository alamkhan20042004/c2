00:00.330 --> 00:01.500
Instructor: Right, so the first step

00:01.500 --> 00:05.460
into the server side attacks is information gathering.

00:05.460 --> 00:07.290
Information gathering is very important

00:07.290 --> 00:10.710
because it'll show us the operating system of the target,

00:10.710 --> 00:13.470
the installed programs or the running services

00:13.470 --> 00:17.220
on the target, the ports associated with these services.

00:17.220 --> 00:19.080
Now, from these installed services,

00:19.080 --> 00:21.450
we can try and get into the system.

00:21.450 --> 00:24.450
We can do this by trying the default passwords

00:24.450 --> 00:26.130
and we've seen this before

00:26.130 --> 00:28.170
in the network penetration testing part,

00:28.170 --> 00:32.520
where the iPad had ssh service installed,

00:32.520 --> 00:35.850
which basically give you full access to the computer

00:35.850 --> 00:38.220
if the person still uses the default password,

00:38.220 --> 00:39.453
which was at Pine.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.510
So we can do this with any other service,

00:42.510 --> 00:44.760
and we'll see another example here today.

00:44.760 --> 00:46.800
Another thing that we can do is,

00:46.800 --> 00:49.170
there's a lot of people that install services

00:49.170 --> 00:50.850
and misconfigure them.

00:50.850 --> 00:53.100
So we'll have another example of this.

00:53.100 --> 00:56.850
A lot of these services are designed to give access to

00:56.850 --> 00:59.100
that computer, but they obviously need

00:59.100 --> 01:01.110
to have some security implementations.

01:01.110 --> 01:04.110
People often misconfigure these services,

01:04.110 --> 01:08.010
so we can take advantage of these misconfigurations

01:08.010 --> 01:10.770
and gain access to these computers.

01:10.770 --> 01:12.750
Some of them might even have back doors

01:12.750 --> 01:14.430
and we'll see an example of that.

01:14.430 --> 01:17.310
And a lot of them would have vulnerabilities

01:17.310 --> 01:19.440
such as remote buffer overflows

01:19.440 --> 01:22.920
or cut execution vulnerabilities that allow us to again,

01:22.920 --> 01:25.470
gain full access to that computer.

01:25.470 --> 01:28.170
Now the simplest way on doing this is something

01:28.170 --> 01:30.870
that we've seen before, which is using Zenmap.

01:30.870 --> 01:34.980
So we use Zenmap using the IP, we get a list of all

01:34.980 --> 01:38.190
of these services and then Google maybe each one of them

01:38.190 --> 01:41.790
and see if they contain any vulnerabilities.

01:41.790 --> 01:44.190
Now we've seen how we used Zenmap before,

01:44.190 --> 01:47.490
but I just wanna convey the idea of anything is a computer.

01:47.490 --> 01:50.490
And we've seen before how the metasploitable device,

01:50.490 --> 01:52.470
this device is actually a website.

01:52.470 --> 01:53.880
It has a web server running.

01:53.880 --> 01:56.250
So websites are nothing different than this.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.740
If you want to get an IP of a website, all you have

01:58.740 --> 02:00.090
to do is just do a ping.

02:00.090 --> 02:03.480
So for example, if we're targeting Facebook, so all we have

02:03.480 --> 02:07.290
to do is do ping facebook.com

02:07.290 --> 02:09.090
and we'll get their IP right here.

02:09.090 --> 02:10.890
So we have Facebook's IP

02:10.890 --> 02:14.010
and we'll be able to run Zenmap against it

02:14.010 --> 02:17.070
and get a list of all the running services on Facebook.

02:17.070 --> 02:18.420
Now, obviously I'm not gonna do that

02:18.420 --> 02:20.100
because I'm not allowed to do that.

02:20.100 --> 02:23.370
What I'm going to do is I'm gonna run Zenmap against this

02:23.370 --> 02:24.900
metasploitable device,

02:24.900 --> 02:27.210
which basically is a computer device

02:27.210 --> 02:30.180
and that's what we're interested into testing.

02:30.180 --> 02:32.310
Again, I can't really stress this anymore.

02:32.310 --> 02:35.790
Anything is a computer, whether it's a website, a server,

02:35.790 --> 02:39.390
any online service, a phone, anything is a computer.

02:39.390 --> 02:43.080
So you can go about penetration anything the same way.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.830
So I'm gonna run Zenmap

02:45.873 --> 02:47.100
just the same way that we did before.

02:47.100 --> 02:48.540
So I'm gonna go on my activities.

02:48.540 --> 02:53.540
I'm just gonna look for Zenmap and here is Zenmap.

02:54.613 --> 02:58.353
And I'm gonna put the IP of my target

02:58.353 --> 03:00.840
of the metasploitable device,

03:00.840 --> 03:05.340
which was 10.1404.

03:05.340 --> 03:07.830
So remember in the network penetration testing part,

03:07.830 --> 03:09.300
we used to put the base IP

03:09.300 --> 03:12.060
and put it over 24 to cover all the IPs

03:12.060 --> 03:13.500
around us in the network.

03:13.500 --> 03:17.100
In this case, you might be testing a remote IP.

03:17.100 --> 03:19.110
So for example, in the Facebook case, all you have

03:19.110 --> 03:22.860
to do is just put the Facebook IP in there and test it.

03:22.860 --> 03:25.290
Now that's granted that you have permission to do that.

03:25.290 --> 03:27.510
Now I don't have permission, so I'm not gonna do that.

03:27.510 --> 03:29.910
What I have permission to do is test my own device,

03:29.910 --> 03:32.130
which is installed on the same network as me.

03:32.130 --> 03:33.570
So that's why I'm putting that IP.

03:33.570 --> 03:35.520
But you can literally put any IP you want

03:35.520 --> 03:37.350
in there and test it.

03:37.350 --> 03:38.550
So I'm gonna hit on scan

03:40.320 --> 03:41.850
and this will give me a list

03:41.850 --> 03:44.640
of all the installed applications.

03:44.640 --> 03:47.070
Okay, so the scan is finished now

03:47.070 --> 03:51.210
and we have a lot of open ports, a lot of services.

03:51.210 --> 03:53.970
What I advise you to do in this case now

03:53.970 --> 03:55.800
if you wanna do a simple test,

03:55.800 --> 04:00.000
is you literally go on ports, port by port, read what it is,

04:00.000 --> 04:01.950
and Google the name of the program.

04:01.950 --> 04:05.610
So for example, we have Port 21 here, that's an FTP port.

04:05.610 --> 04:10.020
FTP is a service that's installed

04:10.020 --> 04:11.760
to allow people to upload

04:11.760 --> 04:14.703
or download files from the remote server.

04:16.050 --> 04:18.720
So we can see usually FTP services

04:18.720 --> 04:20.940
use a username and a password.

04:20.940 --> 04:24.030
But you can see that this service has been misconfigured

04:24.030 --> 04:26.820
and it allows anonymous FTP login.

04:26.820 --> 04:29.280
So unlike the SSH that we used

04:29.280 --> 04:32.070
before in the network penetration testing we had,

04:32.070 --> 04:33.720
we used the default password.

04:33.720 --> 04:36.660
With this, you'll be able to log in without a password.

04:36.660 --> 04:39.570
So all we have to do is download an FTP client,

04:39.570 --> 04:42.660
such as FileZilla and you'll be able

04:42.660 --> 04:46.950
to connect using this IP address on port 21.

04:46.950 --> 04:48.240
Now, again, I'm not gonna explain

04:48.240 --> 04:49.500
this 'cause it's very simple.

04:49.500 --> 04:52.980
You literally download the application and connect to it.

04:52.980 --> 04:55.620
What else you can do is you can Google this,

04:55.620 --> 04:57.180
this is an FTP server.

04:57.180 --> 04:58.770
You can literally Google this

04:58.770 --> 05:00.720
and see if it has any issues,

05:00.720 --> 05:05.070
if it has any misconfigurations, if it has any

05:05.070 --> 05:08.040
known code execution exploits.

05:08.040 --> 05:12.720
So I know if you Google this now, this particular

05:12.720 --> 05:15.900
application has a backdoor installed with it.

05:15.900 --> 05:18.630
For now, I'd like to show you something simpler just

05:18.630 --> 05:20.553
so that we make this shorter.

05:21.600 --> 05:23.790
So what I'm going to do now is I'm gonna have

05:23.790 --> 05:24.840
a look on the 512.

05:24.840 --> 05:26.880
So let's assume we went on them one by one,

05:26.880 --> 05:28.350
we couldn't find anything

05:28.350 --> 05:31.200
and we reached the 512 TCP port.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.760
So I'm gonna copy this.

05:32.760 --> 05:35.280
This is the service that's running on this port.

05:35.280 --> 05:37.110
So literally, I don't know what's this.

05:37.110 --> 05:39.903
So I'm gonna copy it, go and Google and Google it.

05:42.660 --> 05:46.050
Okay so we're gonna have a look on the first result

05:46.050 --> 05:50.100
that we got here and we can see

05:50.100 --> 05:52.620
that this is a remote execution program.

05:52.620 --> 05:54.840
So that's very nice. That's very cool.

05:54.840 --> 05:57.930
So if we manage to log in with this,

05:57.930 --> 06:01.440
we'll be able to execute commands on the target computer

06:01.440 --> 06:03.990
and it uses the RSHR login.

06:03.990 --> 06:06.720
That's a program that ships with Linux

06:06.720 --> 06:09.840
that allows you similar to SSH, you can, in a way

06:09.840 --> 06:12.510
that lets you execute remote commands on

06:12.510 --> 06:13.653
the target computer.

06:14.550 --> 06:17.790
So let's go back and see how we can connect to this.

06:17.790 --> 06:20.280
So I'm gonna do our rlogin,

06:20.280 --> 06:22.620
and again, I don't know how to use this app,

06:22.620 --> 06:26.013
so I'm gonna do the help to see how to use it.

06:27.540 --> 06:30.513
And we can see that the format is rlogin.

06:31.350 --> 06:33.660
You put the options that you want.

06:33.660 --> 06:36.810
So what's important here is the username

06:36.810 --> 06:39.810
and the host, which is the target IP.

06:39.810 --> 06:41.250
So this is what we're gonna do.

06:41.250 --> 06:42.603
We're gonna do rlogin,

06:43.860 --> 06:46.173
we're gonna put the username as root.

06:47.370 --> 06:49.680
Again, we said root is the user

06:49.680 --> 06:52.650
with the most privileges on the system.

06:52.650 --> 06:55.353
And we'll put the target IP, which is 10.20.

06:58.380 --> 07:00.540
Now, as you can see now, we are logged into

07:00.540 --> 07:02.610
the metasploitable machine here.

07:02.610 --> 07:06.210
And if I do ID to get my ID, you can see

07:06.210 --> 07:09.840
that I am root, if I get where I am, PWD,

07:09.840 --> 07:11.220
I'm in the root directory.

07:11.220 --> 07:13.260
I can list stuff.

07:13.260 --> 07:15.543
If I do a uname -a,

07:16.650 --> 07:18.270
that'll list the host name

07:18.270 --> 07:19.980
and the kernel that's running on the machine.

07:19.980 --> 07:23.130
And as you can see that I am in the metasploitable machine

07:23.130 --> 07:24.810
with the root access.

07:24.810 --> 07:28.835
So this was a manual way, a basic way of gaining access

07:28.835 --> 07:32.550
to the target computer only by a misconfiguration

07:32.550 --> 07:33.720
of an installed service.

07:33.720 --> 07:38.100
So the rlogin service was not configured properly.

07:38.100 --> 07:41.610
All we had to do is just Google what came with that port

07:41.610 --> 07:44.760
and we managed to find, or we managed to log in

07:44.760 --> 07:47.343
and gain full access to the target computer.

07:48.450 --> 07:51.930
Now again, the key point here is you do a Zenmap scan

07:51.930 --> 07:54.810
and then you go on each port that you find, you Google

07:54.810 --> 07:56.280
that port and you'd be looking

07:56.280 --> 07:59.850
for misconfigurations, default passwords.

07:59.850 --> 08:02.550
If this target service came in with a backdoor

08:02.550 --> 08:05.850
or code execution, maybe it just wasn't programmed properly

08:05.850 --> 08:08.070
or it had a flaw that can be used

08:08.070 --> 08:09.750
to gain access to that computer.

08:09.750 --> 08:11.730
Now we'll have examples of these things

08:11.730 --> 08:13.473
in future videos as well.
