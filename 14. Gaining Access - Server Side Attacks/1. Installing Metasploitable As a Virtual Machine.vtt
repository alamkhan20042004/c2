00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.550
<v ->Now in the next lectures,</v>

2
00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.220
we're gonna start talking about server-side attacks.

3
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.160
I'm gonna teach you what a server is,

4
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.610
and we're gonna talk about that in details.

5
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.660
But before we jump into this,

6
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.460
we need to have a computer

7
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.630
or a machine that acts as a server

8
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.520
so that we can try to hack into it.

9
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.340
So similar to the way that we had a Windows machine,

10
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.430
to practice attacks that we can launch against normal users,

11
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.760
we need to have another virtual machine

12
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.010
that behaves like a server

13
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.410
so that we can practice server-side attacks against it

14
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.113
and see how we can hack into servers.

15
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.180
So the machine that we're gonna use is called

16
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.650
Metasploitable

17
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.940
and it's a virtual machine that's built on Linux

18
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.770
and it contains a number of services

19
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.020
that's typically used by servers.

20
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.070
It also contains a number of web applications

21
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.540
that act exactly like normal web applications

22
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.320
and use the same technologies used by normal servers

23
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.990
and normal web applications.

24
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.090
So, we're gonna install this machine

25
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.600
and then in the future,

26
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.680
we're gonna use it as a target

27
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.950
to learn how to hack into servers

28
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.210
and how to hack into websites.

29
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.760
You can download this from the following link.

30
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.580
Now I've also included this link

31
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.640
in the resources of this lecture.

32
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.530
If you click on this link, you'll get this page.

33
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.910
And all you have to do is simply click on download

34
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.430
to download it.

35
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.540
I've already done that to save time.

36
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.730
So, if I go to my downloads directory in here,

37
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.080
you will see that I have a ZIP archive

38
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.773
in here called Metasploitable2.

39
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.370
And we know that this is an archive,

40
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.950
a ZIP archive because we can see the icon

41
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.750
and you can see the file type.

42
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.610
So in order to uncompressed this,

43
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:47.830
as we've seen before,

44
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.680
we have to first double click it to access it,

45
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.080
we're gonna right click and copy.

46
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.033
We're gonna go back one directory and paste it here.

47
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.240
On Linux, you'll have to right click it

48
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.240
and click on extract here

49
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.410
and on macOS,

50
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.410
you're gonna have to double click it to uncompress it.

51
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:07.620
We're gonna give it some time

52
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.610
to uncompress the contents of this file.

53
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.620
And once this process is over,

54
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.370
you'll see that you'll have a new directory in here

55
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.620
with the contents of this virtual machine.

56
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.770
To import it in VMware,

57
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.710
we're gonna double click VMware to open it.

58
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.450
And we're gonna click on open a virtual machine.

59
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.220
We're gonna navigate to the location

60
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.550
where we downloaded this virtual machine,

61
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.460
so it's in my downloads.

62
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.440
It's called Metasploitable2 dash Linux.

63
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.350
And the only file that we can click is this file,

64
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.210
called Metaspoitable.

65
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.410
We're gonna open it

66
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.160
and perfect, as you can see VM-ware added there for us.

67
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.610
You can click on edit virtual machine settings,

68
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.440
to edit it settings.

69
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.050
The main thing you want to make sure is

70
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.530
that it's connected to the NAT network,

71
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.940
as you can see in here,

72
00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.070
the same NAT network

73
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.720
that all of the other machines are connected to.

74
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.050
Once you're sure with that,

75
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.280
we're gonna click on start, to start it.

76
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.973
We're gonna say, I copied it.

77
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.730
This pop-up is asking us

78
00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.320
if we want to install the VMware tools for this machine,

79
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.640
this is not necessary at all, especially for this machine.

80
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.640
So we're gonna to click on remind me later,

81
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.473
and perfect.

82
00:03:21.473 --> 00:03:22.400
As you can see,

83
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.240
this machine is installed now and ready to be used.

84
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.910
Now it's asking us to log in,

85
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.773
so the default username is msfadmin,

86
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.370
and the default password is the same: msfadmin, as well.

87
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.260
But you'll notice when typing the password

88
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.720
you will not see the characters on screen,

89
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.553
this is normal,

90
00:03:44.553 --> 00:03:47.320
it's a security feature to prevent people beside you

91
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.730
from seeing the password.

92
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.560
So simply type msfadmin,

93
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.660
and hit enter,

94
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.920
and you should be allowed to log in.

95
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.300
And that's pretty much it,

96
00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.710
right now we have this virtual machine installed

97
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.710
inside our own main operating system within our hiking club.

98
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.310
And we're gonna use it as a target

99
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.820
to practice a number of attacks.

100
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.920
Don't be intimidated by the way this machine looks,

101
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.960
we're actually not gonna be using it much,

102
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.610
we're only gonna be using it as a target.

103
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.410
And you'll know what I mean, as we go through the course.

104
00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.310
So for now, our job is done.

105
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.030
We managed to install a vulnerable server

106
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.950
as a virtual machine so we can test server-side attacks

107
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.203
and other attacks in the next lectures in this course.
