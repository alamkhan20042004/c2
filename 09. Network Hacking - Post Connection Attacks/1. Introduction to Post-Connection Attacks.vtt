<v ->In this section, we're gonna talk about</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.320
post-connection attacks, so attacks that you can do

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.830
after connecting to your target network.

4
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.340
Now, it doesn't matter whether the target network

5
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.860
is a WiFi network or a wired, or an Ethernet network.

6
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.280
It really doesn't matter.

7
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.910
As long as you gained access to this network,

8
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.220
as long as you're able to connect to it,

9
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.300
you'll be able to do all of the attacks

10
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.463
that I'm gonna show you in this section.

11
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.620
Now you'll notice, once connected, you can do

12
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.340
so many cool things, so you'll be able to

13
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.620
gather detailed information about all of the clients

14
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.720
connected to the same network.

15
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.659
You'll also be able to intercept data and see

16
00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:47.100
any usernames, passwords or any information

17
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.130
they use on the internet.

18
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.810
You'll be able to modify data as it's being sent

19
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.000
in the air, so you'll be able to inject evil code

20
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.363
and do so many cool things on the network.

21
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.870
Now, to do all of the attacks that I'm gonna show you

22
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.190
in here, you have two options.

23
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.143
The first option is to run the attacks against

24
00:01:08.143 --> 00:01:11.900
a virtual NAT network against the Windows machine.

25
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.060
You just need to make sure that the virtual Windows machine

26
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.913
is connected to the same NAT network as the Kali machine.

27
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.200
Or, you can run the attacks against real computers

28
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.830
connected to your real WiFi network, and you need to

29
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.400
make sure that you have a wireless interface connected

30
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.280
to the Kali machine, and the Kali machine

31
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.313
needs to be connected to your target WiFi network.

32
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.490
Now, throughout this section, I'm actually

33
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.778
gonna be using both options, so I'm gonna be running

34
00:01:43.778 --> 00:01:47.060
some attacks against the WiFi network, and I'll be running

35
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.450
some against my virtual NAT network, just to make sure

36
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.700
that you're comfortable with running all of these attacks

37
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.880
in different environments and in different networks.

38
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.820
Because like I said, it doesn't really matter

39
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.300
how you gained your access to the network,

40
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.980
the network type doesn't really matter, either,

41
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.653
as long as you are able to connect to the target network.
