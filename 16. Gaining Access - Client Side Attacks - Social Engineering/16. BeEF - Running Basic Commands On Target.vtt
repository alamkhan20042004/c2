00:00:01.221 --> 00:00:03.972
[Instructor] So now that we have our browser or taget hooked

2
00:00:03.972 --> 00:00:06.680
we can go on to commands and start

3
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.760
executing commands on that target.

4
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.030
You can use search to filter, looking for certain command

5
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.750
if you know what your looking for.

6
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.750
Or you can use the categories and look for commands

7
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.380
suitable to what you want to do on the targeted computer.

8
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.910
Some of this information gathering commands,

9
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.800
some of them are social engineering,

10
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.920
some of them will even give you full control

11
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.740
over the target computer.

12
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.040
There's a lot of commands. So once we able to go

13
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.740
over all of them. But I'll be showing you some of the

14
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.180
most important commands and examples of simple once as well.

15
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.933
So you know how to experiment and run the other commands.

16
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.840
So were starting if you go into browser you'll see commands

17
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.488
related to stuff that you can do inside the browser.

18
00:00:48.488 --> 00:00:51.570
So you can see things that will allow you to for example

19
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.199
get a screen shot and you'll be able to try and gain

20
00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.530
and turn on the web cam and see if it works.

21
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.103
And basically open the webcam on the target.

22
00:01:01.103 --> 00:01:05.390
You can gather information, uhm if you go here

23
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.265
on the exploits, you'll see a number of exploits

24
00:01:08.265 --> 00:01:11.440
that you can run, again depending on what's running

25
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.073
on the target computer, you can run them.

26
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.010
All you have to do is just click on the module

27
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.090
that you want to run and click on the execute.

28
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.660
Sometimes some modules need to set some options to be set up

29
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.240
and we'll have examples of that as well.

30
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.090
In the social engineering again there are some

31
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.550
really cool stuff that you can do and you can

32
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.130
show fake updates, fake notification bars

33
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.223
and stuff like that.

34
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.210
So lets have an example of a very simple command.

35
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.238
So again were gonna do just an alert to show an alert box

36
00:01:42.238 --> 00:01:44.210
(clicking).

37
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.000
So I'm just using the search to filter

38
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.900
and you can see here this will just create an alert dialog

39
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.030
and its going to say "beef alert dialog".

40
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.210
You can modify this and type anything you want.

41
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.160
For exampple, I'm gonna type in "test".

42
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.251
And then when you hit "execute".

43
00:02:01.251 --> 00:02:04.399
Go on to target, and you'll see that the target

44
00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.690
got a message saying "test".

45
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.563
So this has been injected into the target browser.

46
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.210
And other cool thing that you can do

47
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.863
is the roll java script.

48
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:18.740
And this will allow you

49
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.380
to execute any java script you want.

50
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.510
So again you can look for google for a useful

51
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.640
java script code for example a key-logger

52
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.500
or whatever you want to do. Or you can write your own

53
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.312
if you know java script. And basically whatever

54
00:02:30.312 --> 00:02:33.790
you write here will be executed on the target.

55
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.450
Again were only seeing an alert,

56
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.720
and this will only going say "beef roll java script"

57
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.643
I'm gonna execute,

58
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.710
and here we go again

59
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.547
we got a dialog saying "beef roll java script".

60
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.700
Lets see if we can get a screen shot of a target computer.

61
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.850
And were going to use a plug-in called "spy".

62
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.233
Spyder eye I think, yeah. Spyder eye.

63
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.653
So again, click on in, hit "execute"

64
00:03:04.306 --> 00:03:07.273
then were gonna click on the command here.

65
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.870
Looks like this time didn't work properly.

66
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.113
Lets just do it again.

67
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.380
And here we go, as you can see

68
00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.380
we got a screen shot of what the target person is looking up

69
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.050
another really good plug-in is a plug-in

70
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.823
its a redirect plug-in.

71
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.350
And it will basically allow you to

72
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.410
redirect the browser to any webpage you want.

73
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.520
This could be very useful because you can use it

74
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.860
to redirect the target person and tell them

75
00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.110
that they need to download that update

76
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.020
and instead of giving them an update, give them a backdoor.

77
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.540
You can redirect them to a fake login page for example.

78
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.453
For Facebook, you can really anything you want with this.

79
00:03:56.453 --> 00:03:59.300
So, you can set the website that you want the target

80
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.247
to be redirected to and were gonna redirect them to

81
00:04:02.247 --> 00:04:05.653
"beef project" in this example. and once you hit execute.

82
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.500
As you can see here, they're redirected to "beef project".

83
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.750
These are some of the basic modules that you can use.

84
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.350
Again you can experiment with these.

85
00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.660
Go over them and see what would be useful

86
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.483
in your particular situation.
