00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.700
<v ->In this video, I'd like to show you</v>

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.900
how to target a person.

3
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.169
So, we're gonna start with literally just a name,

4
00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:10.780
just a person's name, and then we'll see

5
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.540
how we can gather information about that person,

6
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.840
and then build up an attack strategy as well.

7
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.490
And as we do that, I'm gonna show you some more features

8
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.250
of Maltego and how to configure a few more settings.

9
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.390
So, I'm gonna start a new graph

10
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.390
by clicking on the plus sign right here.

11
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.763
I'm gonna look for personal,

12
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.773
and I'm gonna look for a person.

13
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.210
And right here, we have a person entity.

14
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.220
Now, as I said in this example, I'm gonna assume

15
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.210
that I have a target, and I know their name.

16
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.430
I know their first name, and their second name.

17
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.100
And again, that target is me,

18
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.760
and my first name is Zaid,

19
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.720
and my second name is Sabith.

20
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.040
So, I'm gonna go here on the property list.

21
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.320
I'm gonna set the first name.

22
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.200
Just double-click it.

23
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.920
I'm gonna set it to Zaid,

24
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.423
and then I'm gonna set the surname to Sabith.

25
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.060
And I'm just gonna set this to capital.

26
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.563
Doesn't really matter but just looks better.

27
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.590
Now, let's see what information

28
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.480
can we gather about this entity.

29
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.510
Again, as we usual, all we have to do

30
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.760
is just right-click it, and see what we can get.

31
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.483
So, I'm already in the Paterva category,

32
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.423
and I'm gonna go to all transformers,

33
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.160
and you can see we can get associated emails.

34
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.420
We can transfer this to a radio person.

35
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.040
We can try to get a phone number.

36
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.590
We can try to get a Twitter account.

37
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.160
You can try all of these.

38
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.500
For now, I'm gonna try to get a website

39
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.073
or websites for this person.

40
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.160
Now, this is gonna ask you if you want

41
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.540
to look for a specific domain name.

42
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.370
I'm gonna assume that I know nothing.

43
00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.040
So, I'm just gonna put a space in here in both entries.

44
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.623
So, that just means look up for any websites

45
00:02:02.623 --> 00:02:04.793
that are associated with this person.

46
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.140
Now, you can see that we managed

47
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.950
to get a number of websites right here,

48
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.540
and all of these websites

49
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.170
are associated with Zaid Sabith.

50
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.430
Now, that doesn't really mean that these websites

51
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.720
are actually associated with your target,

52
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.590
'cause there could be another person named Zaid Sabith.

53
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.260
So, you'll have to go on each one of these,

54
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.820
and see which ones actually are related to that person.

55
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.070
For example, if we click on the Facebook here,

56
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.090
I'm gonna double-click it to see what information is there,

57
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.840
and I'm gonna go on the properties,

58
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.140
and you'll see that we have the Facebook URLs

59
00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.820
that are associated with that person with that name.

60
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.730
Now, I'm gonna copy all of these,

61
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.140
and I'm just gonna put them in a text file,

62
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.543
so we can read them better.

63
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.310
And you can see we have three profiles.

64
00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.370
Now, in a real life situation, you should be going

65
00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.910
into each of these profiles, and see which ones

66
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.010
actually are related to your person.

67
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.900
I'm not gonna do that because the three of them

68
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.290
are actually not related to me at all.

69
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.910
So, this is really not useful, and you'll just move in.

70
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.700
In this case, you'll just come back,

71
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.960
move into the next entity, and see what's useful.

72
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.860
And I highly recommend you delete the ones

73
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.820
that are not useful, because they'll just make it harder

74
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:22.653
to look through things.

75
00:03:22.653 --> 00:03:24.550
So, you can just click it, press delete,

76
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.440
and that'll delete it for you.

77
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.480
Now, the LinkedIn profile right here again,

78
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.440
you can double-click it,

79
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.690
and see which profile it links you to,

80
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.470
but again, it's not my own profile,

81
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.320
and you can see that once you actually go through the URL.

82
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.270
So, for now I'm just gonna delete that.

83
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.880
And you can see the rest of the stuff in here

84
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.960
is actually all related to me.

85
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.970
So, it's all related to your target,

86
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.800
and you can try and double-click each one of them,

87
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.560
go to the properties, look for the URL,

88
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.660
and open it in your browser.

89
00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.500
When you do that, you'll get the information

90
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.100
that's related to that person,

91
00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.480
and hopefully it'll help you to form some sort

92
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.670
of an attack strategy or help you get even more information.

93
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.030
For now, because I've already looked on all of them,

94
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.050
I'm gonna focus on one of them which is the udemy link,

95
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.310
so the information related to me on udemy.

96
00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.130
I'm gonna double-click this like we did before,

97
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.853
and I'm gonna go on properties,

98
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.730
and you can see that we have a URL or description here.

99
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:22.823
I'm gonna copy that.

100
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.683
I'm gonna put it in my text file right here,

101
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.703
and I'm just gonna copy the URL,

102
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.923
and open it in my browser right here.

103
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.510
So, you can see that this URL is related

104
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.150
to our target person, and you can see

105
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.350
that it's leading us to a course that's taught by myself.

106
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.170
Now, this is not really useful.

107
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.370
We can see that the target person

108
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.720
is teaching online courses.

109
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.340
Whatever, not very useful.

110
00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.910
But if we go back and look at the other URLs.

111
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.030
So this had two URLs if I scroll back to the left,

112
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.210
we can see we have the first URL right here,

113
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.270
and this URL is my profile URL.

114
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.673
So, I'm gonna copy it again, and paste it in the browser.

115
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.260
And you can see this is showing us the profile

116
00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.800
for the target person.

117
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.530
You can see that it's the same name.

118
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.530
You can see their picture, so you know this is your target.

119
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.300
You can see a description about what they do,

120
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.037
but you probably already know that,

121
00:05:28.037 --> 00:05:29.640
but you can see some useful stuff.

122
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.450
For example, you can see that they used to work

123
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.500
with a company called iSecurity.

124
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.430
So again, you can go to what we did previously.

125
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.020
Research iSecurity, add their website as a target,

126
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.860
and then gather all the information that we were able to do,

127
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.883
and then use that to build up a strategy against Zaid.

128
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:48.680
Now, we're not gonna do that

129
00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.750
because I've already done something like that.

130
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:51.950
So, we're gonna try to see

131
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.823
what other information we can get.

132
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.220
What's really useful in here, we can see that the person

133
00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.810
is sharing a few links.

134
00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.070
So, they're sharing their YouTube channel.

135
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.170
They're sharing their LinkedIn profile.

136
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:04.800
They're sharing their Facebook,

137
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.633
and they're sharing their own blog.

138
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.510
All of these, you can go ahead and browse all

139
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.530
of these things to gather more information

140
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.130
about that person.

141
00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.300
Now, you need to keep in mind that I'm setting my target

142
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.070
to myself, which is an aware person

143
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.500
about computer and information technology,

144
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.180
and even the target I targeted

145
00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.040
in my previous video, iSecurity.

146
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.650
It's an information technology company,

147
00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.380
and even with that, we were able

148
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.530
to gather so much information.

149
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.790
So, when you're targeting normal companies or normal people,

150
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:39.410
it'll be so much easier to get effective information.

151
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.670
So right now, if you actually go look at the YouTube,

152
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.660
look at the LinkedIn, and look at the Facebook,

153
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:45.940
you really won't get much.

154
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.720
Like, even if you click on the Facebook,

155
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.820
you'll see the Facebook won't lead you to anything.

156
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.180
You need to log in, and even after logging in,

157
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.373
you won't get too much useful information.

158
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:58.403
What's useful in my case is if we go on the blog,

159
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.723
and we're gonna go to the about,

160
00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.290
and what's useful in this,

161
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:13.700
is we have the email address of the target person,

162
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.200
and we have their Twitter account,

163
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.710
so this information were not included on udemy,

164
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:22.810
and now we have two really useful pieces of information.

165
00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:24.210
So, in the next video,

166
00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.370
we'll see how we can use this information

167
00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.190
to gather even more info about our target,

168
00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:32.533
and hopefully be able to build up an attack strategy.
