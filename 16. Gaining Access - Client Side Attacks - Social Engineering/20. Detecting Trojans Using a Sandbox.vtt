<v Instructor>Another way to discover malicious files</v>

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.090
is to use a sandbox.

3
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.110
A sandbox is, basically, a place

4
00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.530
where your file will be executed and analyzed.

5
00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.730
They will check if any ports will be opened,

6
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.240
if it's gonna modify registry entries,

7
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.630
if it's gonna do any suspicious (mumbles).

8
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.600
It's not an antivirus program.

9
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.830
Your Trojan might pass antivirus programs like we did.

10
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.320
Our Trojan passes all antivirus programs.

11
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.510
But the sandbox applications or the sandbox environments

12
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.070
will run this into a place, into a controlled environment,

13
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.580
and try to see if it does anything suspicious

14
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.253
and give you a report of that.

15
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.793
You can Google, again, sandbox online.

16
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.163
An example of it is a website called hybrid-analysis.

17
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.550
Using the website is very simple.

18
00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.043
All you have to do is just go to the URL,

19
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.603
and select your file, and upload it.

20
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.130
Now, I've done this already,

21
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.540
so I'm just gonna show you the report

22
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.281
because analyzing the file and doing the report

23
00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:19.590
might take some time.

24
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.790
Once you get the report,

25
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.623
you'll see some basic information.

26
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.730
You'll see that there was,

27
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.920
malicious indicators have been found.

28
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.480
Now, it's hiding it from you, and you have to

29
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.110
use the full version and pay for it to see them,

30
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.050
but you don't really need to see them.

31
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.540
If you read the whole report,

32
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.650
you'll be able to know that this file is malicious

33
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.560
and it's gonna do something bad on your computer.

34
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.150
First of all, you can see that the file

35
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.670
suppresses error boxes.

36
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.403
It doesn't display error boxes.

37
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.283
It also modifies registry.

38
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.573
You can see the registry parameters that it's modifying.

39
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.650
You can see that it's playing with the internet settings,

40
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.900
and with the connections.

41
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.000
You can also see that it's using Windows Socket service,

42
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.943
so it's trying to create connections.

43
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.500
You can also see that it's playing

44
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.363
with the address of the process.

45
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.810
Scrolling down,

46
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.660
you'll see one of the most important indicators.

47
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.110
Now, obviously, there's more information in here.

48
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.120
Right here on the network place,

49
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.093
you'll see that it tries to connect to this IP on port 8080.

50
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.810
Now, again, you can go on this IP

51
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.470
and do a reverse DNS lookup,

52
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.870
and see that this IP is not related to any website.

53
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.510
Also, this, when you upload the payload to this place,

54
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.250
it's never gonna be executed on your computer,

55
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.890
it's gonna be executed on their server

56
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.330
in a sandbox environment.

57
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.520
Now, obviously, the method I showed you,

58
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.590
you should always do it in a virtual box

59
00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.560
when you are executing it here on your Windows.

60
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.150
Always do it in a virtual machine,

61
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.540
don't do it on your main machine.

62
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.050
Or, you can use this method

63
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.610
where you upload it into a sandbox environment.

64
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.670
It'll analyzed for you,

65
00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.320
and then you can read the report.
