1
00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:03.880
<v Instructor>Okay, now let's see how we can build up</v>

2
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.410
an attack strategy against our target,

3
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.050
which is Zaid, a person named Zaid.

4
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.080
Before I do any of that,

5
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.260
I just wanna just do this in front of you,

6
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.790
just organize my workspace, so that we can think

7
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.570
of it properly and come up with ideas.

8
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.840
So I'm gonna delete all of these websites because

9
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.000
they didn't really contain any useful information.

10
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.800
So I'm just gonna keep, the only one

11
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.350
that had useful information was Udemy

12
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.550
and that's the only one that I'm gonna keep.

13
00:00:39.764 --> 00:00:42.097
And I'm gonna move this here

14
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.710
and I'm gonna put Zaid here on the top.

15
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.210
And I'm just gonna click

16
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.340
and drag from here to the email address,

17
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.630
so that we'll know that this,

18
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.223
that Zaid, is associated with the email address.

19
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.210
And I'm just gonna click okay

20
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.010
and you can see now Zaid is associated with this email,

21
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.793
which led us to isecurity.

22
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.000
And then, we're actually gonna just add

23
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
another arrow from Zaid to my Twitter account,

24
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.030
and again, so that just we know that this Twitter account

25
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.900
is associated with this person.

26
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.790
And we have an entity here of Udemy.

27
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.790
We also know that Muhammad Askar right here has this email,

28
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.570
so it has m.askar@isecurity.org.

29
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.470
So we know that this person,

30
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.930
this email is associated with this person.

31
00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.180
And the email is @isecurity.org,

32
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.400
then this person is probably or most definitely

33
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.583
is associated with isecurity.org as well.

34
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.260
And if you actually do a Google search,

35
00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.810
you'll see that this guy is the admin of isecurity.

36
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.770
So again, we're just gonna put an arrow from here to here

37
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.020
and I'm gonna do the same with Mustafa

38
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.643
because you can see we have his email there.

39
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.483
And we'll also associate isecurity with this person.

40
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.113
And I'll just move him here and move this guy there.

41
00:02:33.291 --> 00:02:35.670
And then, over here, I know I made a mess out of this,

42
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.973
but it's much easier when it looks clean.

43
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.023
Okay, this is much better.

44
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.993
Now, let's zoom in a little bit.

45
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.210
Okay, perfect, so our target is Zaid

46
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.330
and we know Zaid uses Udemy and teaches courses there.

47
00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.030
We're also able to see Zaid's blog,

48
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.570
we're able to see his YouTube, LinkedIn,

49
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.730
and all that stuff already.

50
00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.050
Now, that on it's own can make me think

51
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.070
of so many ways to attack Zaid.

52
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.610
We can, looking at how active he is on Udemy,

53
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.950
we can just pretend to be a person from Udemy,

54
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.950
so we can pretend to be someone from the admins of Udemy

55
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.180
and send him a program, for example,

56
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.660
and tell him this is our new beta program

57
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.900
that we're only giving to special instructors.

58
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.640
This way, Zaid will feel privileged

59
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.850
because he's getting something

60
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.100
that other instructors are not getting

61
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.290
and he'll run that file.

62
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.500
And once he runs that file, that file is gonna be a Trojan,

63
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.530
so that file can be a backdoor or a keylogger

64
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.630
or program that will steal his passwords or allow us

65
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.620
to do anything we want on the target computer.

66
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.840
Now, again, like I've said in this section,

67
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.040
we're not gonna be talking about the technical stuff.

68
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.190
We'll talk about that in future lectures

69
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.870
and you'll know how to do this,

70
00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.990
so when I say we'll send him a file that looks like

71
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.520
a normal file, we'll actually be able to do that.

72
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.050
And this normal file, it'll be a normal program,

73
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.023
but at the background, it'll do what we want it to do.

74
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.310
We can also pretend to be from YouTube,

75
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.160
from the blog, from WordPress, from Udemy again,

76
00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.580
and ask him to reset their password.

77
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.180
And give them a link that has a login page

78
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.030
exactly the same as the login page of Udemy or YouTube,

79
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.750
And once they put on their password,

80
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.630
we'll actually get that password.

81
00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.660
So the possibilities are endless there

82
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.433
and we'll talk about ideas on how to all of that later on.

83
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.170
Looking at the connections that we can see here

84
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.790
with isecurity, we can see that this person

85
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.800
has a lot of connections with this company

86
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.150
or with this website.

87
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.660
We can see that he has an email at isecurity.org.

88
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.350
So again, this email is really useful because

89
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.180
this is how we're gonna be communicating with Zaid.

90
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.520
You can also communicate with him through Udemy,

91
00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.460
obviously, as sent as messages,

92
00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.000
but I'm pretty sure that his friends

93
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.370
and yes, my friends don't really

94
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.083
communicate with me over Udemy.

95
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.020
So if you want to target Zaid using his email,

96
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.730
that's another way to do it.

97
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.940
And we have his friends, so we have

98
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.950
one of his friends right here, Mohammad.

99
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.920
And you can see there's so many connections

100
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.210
between him and Zaid.

101
00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.950
They're both friends on Twitter,

102
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.440
they're both active on isecurity,

103
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.520
and they both have @isecurity.org email,

104
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.480
so this makes you think they're not only work colleagues,

105
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.760
they're probably friends as well.

106
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.020
And exploiting this friendship, you can send stuff

107
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.500
to Zaid asking him about anything really.

108
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.010
You can show him pictures of a car

109
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.790
that you want to buy, for example.

110
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.880
You can send him PDFs because you know that both

111
00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.770
of these guys are interested about computer security.

112
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.990
They're running a security website.

113
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.857
And you can just send him a PDF saying,

114
00:05:50.857 --> 00:05:52.980
"Oh ,look at my new ebook."

115
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.930
And when they open the PDF, again, it'll run a file that

116
00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.170
you want it to run on the system, that'll give you,

117
00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.970
gain access on Zaid's system.

118
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.810
Now, again, when you send an email,

119
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.000
you'll be able to send an email that looks exactly

120
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.173
as if it's coming from Mohammad.

121
00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.400
You can do the same to Mustafa,

122
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.040
so you can send stuff to Zaid.

123
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.220
You can send him stuff that they're interested in.

124
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.160
You can send him just pictures.

125
00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.120
You can send him links to ask him to login and do something.

126
00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.420
The possibilities, again, are endless

127
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.000
when it comes to social engineering.

128
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.820
Not only that, but let's say you tried everything

129
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.600
and you couldn't hack into Zaid's system.

130
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.610
You tried to pretend to be all of these people.

131
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.290
You tried all the ideas that you can think of

132
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.620
and you couldn't reach Zaid's system.

133
00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.980
This is not the end of the world.

134
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.250
What you could do is you can actually

135
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.500
try to hack into one of his friends,

136
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.460
so you can try to hack into Mohammad's computer.

137
00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.140
You can try to hack Mustafa's computer.

138
00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.550
From there, try to get into their Facebook

139
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.200
and then, communicate with Zaid over Facebook

140
00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.670
from their Facebook account because you can't really

141
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.090
send a message that looks like it's coming

142
00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.240
from Mohammad on Facebook.

143
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.000
We can only do that with emails,

144
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.940
but again, you can hack into these guys Facebook's accounts

145
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.890
and then, try to hack into Zaid.

146
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.640
Why not hack into their accounts, hack into isecurity?

147
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.270
Because you know that these people are admins.

148
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.430
They have @isecurity emails.

149
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.560
And even if you research their names,

150
00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.490
you'll see that they're admins.

151
00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:28.150
Why not hack into their computers, hack into isecurity?

152
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.380
And Zaid definitely browses isecurity,

153
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.370
so embed a backdoor in there or change one of the files

154
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:37.410
that's hosted into isecurity into a backdoor,

155
00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:39.950
and then, once Zaid downloads it or uses it,

156
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:42.363
you'll be able to hack into his computer.

157
00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.670
Now, again, don't get overwhelmed about

158
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:49.110
all the information I'm saying at the moment.

159
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:51.380
We will take this step by step

160
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.900
and you'll learn how to send these fake emails,

161
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.580
how to create these back doors,

162
00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.180
how to create these keyloggers,

163
00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.880
and all that cool stuff in the next sections of this course.

164
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.300
For now, I just wanted to show you how powerful Maltego is

165
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.510
and how you can use it to gather information

166
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:07.850
about anything, really.

167
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:09.330
We started with just a name.

168
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.530
Literally, we started with Zaid Sabih

169
00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:14.480
and we were able to gather information about his websites,

170
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.150
his blog, his YouTube, his friends, his emails, anything.

171
00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:20.370
We literally profiled the whole person.

172
00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:23.100
And again, this person is a techy person,

173
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.420
a person who is interested into information technology,

174
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.480
so he's very careful with what to share,

175
00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.440
but we were still able to gather enough information

176
00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.610
to build up an attack strategy.

177
00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:36.190
If you do this against a normal person,

178
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:38.513
you'll be surprised about the amount of information

179
00:08:38.513 --> 00:08:40.823
that you'll be able to gather about them.
