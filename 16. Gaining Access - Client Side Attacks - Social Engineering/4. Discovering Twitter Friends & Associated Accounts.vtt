1
00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:03.760
<v Zaid>Right, so now we have the email address</v>

2
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.140
of the target person,

3
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.680
and we have their Twitter account.

4
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.930
So let's start with Twitter

5
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.980
and see what we can get from that.

6
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.640
So I'm gonna open the Twitter account

7
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.383
for the target person right here.

8
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.383
I'm gonna copy the link.

9
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.693
And we're gonna come here,

10
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.173
and we're gonna add a Twitter entity.

11
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.993
So I'm just gonna move all of this to the side.

12
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.900
And we're gonna add a Twitter entity

13
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.993
from the Social Network category.

14
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.550
The problem here is you'll see that there is a Tweet entity,

15
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.950
but there is no Twitter entity.

16
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.020
But Maltego actually has an entity for Twitter,

17
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.310
it's just not being shown in here.

18
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.560
And that's why I said I wanna spend

19
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.060
more time using Maltego with you,

20
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.270
to show you how to access these settings.

21
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.653
So we're gonna go to Entities.

22
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.703
We're gonna go to Manage Entities.

23
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.420
And right here, you can add all of these entities.

24
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.930
So all of these entities are not added to the palette,

25
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.990
to the left in here.

26
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.410
So if you see something in here that's interesting to you,

27
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.910
you can just click on it.

28
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.290
So the one I'm interested in right now

29
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.160
is the Twitter Affiliation,

30
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.840
the membership of the Twitter social network.

31
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.140
I'm gonna click on the three little dots here.

32
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.703
I'm gonna go on Advanced Settings,

33
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.233
and I'm gonna check this box, which says Palette Item.

34
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.840
Now if I click on OK and close this,

35
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.780
you'll see that I have a Twitter entity showing up in here.

36
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.840
So again, I'm gonna use this as normal.

37
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.440
I'm just gonna drag and drop it.

38
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.230
I'm gonna set the name of it here.

39
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.553
So that's gonna be myself, which is Zaid.

40
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.830
And we're gonna put the URL in here.

41
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.210
So that's the URL of the profile.

42
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.560
And I've already copied that, so it's this one.

43
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.120
And my user ID is Zaid_alq,

44
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.803
so I'm gonna put that in here.

45
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.890
And we're good to go.

46
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.460
Now we can gather information

47
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.253
about this person based on their Twitter account.

48
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.470
So I'm gonna right-click it

49
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.560
and see what we can get.

50
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.560
So we can get their Tweets.

51
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.040
We can see the Tweets they sent to people.

52
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.170
We can transfer this to person.

53
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.090
We can get more details.

54
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.250
We can get the followers.

55
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.940
What I really want to get in this is to get their friends

56
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.640
so that I can actually target them through their friends.

57
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.390
So again, I'm just gonna click on the play button here.

58
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.300
And this particular transformer

59
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.610
require you to log in to Twitter.

60
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.540
So as you can see now,

61
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.280
Maltego is telling me that I have to log in to Twitter

62
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.220
to be able to gather information about this person.

63
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.370
So I'm gonna click Yes.

64
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.120
I'll log in, no problem.

65
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.720
And then I'm gonna click on this Sign In right here.

66
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.850
And I'm just gonna log in with a username and a password.

67
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.880
So I'm gonna actually use a different account

68
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.480
than the one that we're gathering information about.

69
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.800
And now it's asking me, do I want to authorize this app?

70
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.013
I'm gonna say yes, authorize it, no problem.

71
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.340
And that's it, now we're logged in to Maltego.

72
00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.290
I'm gonna go back to Maltego, and you can see

73
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.640
that it's telling me I can sign out using this button.

74
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.730
So now I'm logged in to it.

75
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.910
And if I close this, the search will start.

76
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.640
So it's now starting to look

77
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.003
for friends on Twitter, of Zaid.

78
00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.210
And as you can see now,

79
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.870
I managed to get the people that are friends with Zaid,

80
00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.790
and we can see some really interesting stuff.

81
00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.550
Now these are all just websites,

82
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.840
so they're not really very useful.

83
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.430
We can go ahead and pretend

84
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.240
to be a person from these websites,

85
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.470
and there is a high chance of Zaid to respond to it.

86
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.770
But it's not as good as using the people.

87
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:19.970
So I'm actually gonna delete these websites,

88
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.253
just gonna click on Delete.

89
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.763
And we're just gonna organize these.

90
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.850
And now we can see that Zaid has three friends.

91
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.830
And again, we can use all of these friends,

92
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:38.820
right-click them,

93
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.663
and try to gather more information about them.

94
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.650
This is good so far.

95
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.910
And in the next lecture, we'll go back to where we were.

96
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.750
So we gathered the information now

97
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.100
about the Twitter account.

98
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.130
We'll see how to gather information

99
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.513
about the email of that person.
