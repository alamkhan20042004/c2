00:00.450 --> 00:03.000
Lecturer: So now that we signed up with the service,

00:03.000 --> 00:04.380
in this lecture I'm gonna show you

00:04.380 --> 00:08.430
how to use the SMTP servers offered by this service

00:08.430 --> 00:11.370
in order to send fake emails.

00:11.370 --> 00:12.450
So first of all,

00:12.450 --> 00:14.940
we're gonna go on the transactional in here,

00:14.940 --> 00:18.030
and you'll see that we have all of the information

00:18.030 --> 00:22.080
that we need to authenticate with the SMTP servers offered

00:22.080 --> 00:25.713
by this website in order to send the fake emails.

00:26.670 --> 00:29.280
So right now we just need to use a program

00:29.280 --> 00:30.900
in order to authenticate

00:30.900 --> 00:33.270
and then send the fake emails.

00:33.270 --> 00:38.100
So in Kali, we're gonna use a program called send email.

00:38.100 --> 00:41.100
And because this is the first time we're using this program,

00:41.100 --> 00:44.130
it's always a good idea to run the program

00:44.130 --> 00:46.290
with the dash-dash help argument

00:46.290 --> 00:47.520
to see how to use it

00:47.520 --> 00:49.503
and all of the available options.

00:50.400 --> 00:51.810
So scrolling up,

00:51.810 --> 00:55.080
you can see the main usage is send email,

00:55.080 --> 00:56.940
we're using the dash F argument,

00:56.940 --> 00:59.040
and then you set the options.

00:59.040 --> 01:00.510
Now, before doing this,

01:00.510 --> 01:03.810
the first thing I wanna do is set the username

01:03.810 --> 01:07.350
and the password using the dash XU

01:07.350 --> 01:10.020
and the dash XP arguments.

01:10.020 --> 01:14.620
So our command is going to be sendemail -xu

01:16.140 --> 01:17.550
to give the username.

01:17.550 --> 01:19.140
And if we go up,

01:19.140 --> 01:20.880
we have the username here,

01:20.880 --> 01:25.380
which is jhnwck70@gmail.com in my case.

01:25.380 --> 01:27.933
So I'm gonna copy it and paste it here.

01:28.830 --> 01:30.600
Next we need to set the password,

01:30.600 --> 01:33.810
we're gonna use the dash XP to do that.

01:33.810 --> 01:35.280
And again, if we scroll up,

01:35.280 --> 01:37.380
we have the password here,

01:37.380 --> 01:39.933
so copy and paste it there.

01:40.860 --> 01:43.380
Next we'll need to specify the server.

01:43.380 --> 01:46.050
So we're gonna use the dash S option.

01:46.050 --> 01:48.750
And as you can see, you first give it the server,

01:48.750 --> 01:50.970
colon, followed by the port.

01:50.970 --> 01:52.593
An example is this.

01:53.580 --> 01:56.040
So if we go up, you can see

01:56.040 --> 01:58.920
that our server is this one right here.

01:58.920 --> 02:01.260
So again, control C to copy it.

02:01.260 --> 02:05.010
And our port is going to be 587.

02:05.010 --> 02:07.560
So going down, we're gonna do dash S

02:07.560 --> 02:09.120
to specify the server,

02:09.120 --> 02:11.820
we're gonna give it the server that we just copied.

02:11.820 --> 02:14.940
And I'm gonna type colon followed by the port.

02:14.940 --> 02:18.420
And as we've seen before, the port is 587.

02:18.420 --> 02:21.183
So I'm gonna type 587.

02:23.040 --> 02:26.220
So far we haven't composed the email yet.

02:26.220 --> 02:28.890
All we're doing is we're authenticating

02:28.890 --> 02:30.600
with the email server.

02:30.600 --> 02:33.480
So this step is very similar to what you do

02:33.480 --> 02:35.430
when you go to gmail.com.

02:35.430 --> 02:38.190
For example, the first thing that you get asked for

02:38.190 --> 02:40.230
is your username and a password.

02:40.230 --> 02:43.830
And only once you log in you can start sending emails.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.300
So this is what we're doing right here.

02:45.300 --> 02:49.380
We first log it in with our username, password, and server.

02:49.380 --> 02:50.610
And now that we're logged in,

02:50.610 --> 02:51.570
we can go ahead

02:51.570 --> 02:54.270
and start composing our email.

02:54.270 --> 02:55.620
Now the cool thing about this,

02:55.620 --> 02:58.290
this is not an ordinary email client.

02:58.290 --> 03:00.570
We can actually set the from email,

03:00.570 --> 03:02.160
and when the email is delivered,

03:02.160 --> 03:04.230
it's gonna appear as if it's sent

03:04.230 --> 03:07.650
from the from email that we pick in here.

03:07.650 --> 03:10.410
Now, from our information gathering stage,

03:10.410 --> 03:15.410
we discovered that our target's email is zaid@isecurity.org.

03:15.480 --> 03:18.030
And we discovered that this target, Zaid,

03:18.030 --> 03:21.990
is linked to another person named Mohammad Askar.

03:21.990 --> 03:26.073
And his email is m.askar@isecurity.org.

03:27.120 --> 03:28.950
So when picking this from email,

03:28.950 --> 03:31.680
you wanna make sure that you pick an existing email,

03:31.680 --> 03:33.150
something that exists,

03:33.150 --> 03:35.550
and you wanna make sure that you pick an email

03:35.550 --> 03:38.940
that your target usually receives emails from.

03:38.940 --> 03:40.200
This will increase the chances

03:40.200 --> 03:42.240
of your target opening the email,

03:42.240 --> 03:43.620
and it'll also ensure

03:43.620 --> 03:46.080
that the email will be delivered in the inbox

03:46.080 --> 03:47.283
and not in the spam.

03:48.330 --> 03:53.317
So I'm gonna set my from email to m.askar@isecurity.org.

03:54.600 --> 03:57.030
Next, we're gonna use the dash T option

03:57.030 --> 03:58.650
to specify the email

03:58.650 --> 04:01.830
that we want to send this email to.

04:01.830 --> 04:04.470
And from our information gathering stage,

04:04.470 --> 04:09.470
we know that the email of our target is zaid@isecurity.org.

04:09.810 --> 04:12.330
Next, we're gonna use the dash U argument

04:12.330 --> 04:15.570
to specify the title of the email.

04:15.570 --> 04:19.080
So I'm just gonna say, "Check out this car".

04:19.080 --> 04:21.690
And then we're gonna use the dash M option

04:21.690 --> 04:24.510
to specify the message body.

04:24.510 --> 04:26.670
Now, when specifying the title

04:26.670 --> 04:27.900
and the message body,

04:27.900 --> 04:29.520
you wanna keep in mind

04:29.520 --> 04:31.800
the person you're pretending to be,

04:31.800 --> 04:33.120
the target person

04:33.120 --> 04:35.820
and the relationship between the two.

04:35.820 --> 04:37.980
If you're pretending to be a boss

04:37.980 --> 04:40.470
or a colleague, then you might want

04:40.470 --> 04:42.420
to keep these more formal,

04:42.420 --> 04:45.030
but in my case, I'm pretending to be a friend,

04:45.030 --> 04:48.030
so I'm gonna keep my title and the message casual

04:48.030 --> 04:49.177
and I'm just gonna say,

04:49.177 --> 04:51.120
"Hey man, check out this car.

04:51.120 --> 04:53.430
I'm thinking of buying it."

04:53.430 --> 04:55.230
And then we wanna give him a link

04:55.230 --> 04:56.970
to download the Trojan

04:56.970 --> 05:01.110
that shows a picture of a car that we created before.

05:01.110 --> 05:04.860
So you can upload your Trojan to any file sharing service.

05:04.860 --> 05:08.100
I chose to upload it to Dropbox

05:08.100 --> 05:10.080
and I've already logged into my

05:10.080 --> 05:11.910
Dropbox account in here.

05:11.910 --> 05:14.400
If you don't know how to upload stuff to Dropbox,

05:14.400 --> 05:16.560
you simply click on the upload in here,

05:16.560 --> 05:17.730
you select the file,

05:17.730 --> 05:21.120
and then the file will be uploaded in here.

05:21.120 --> 05:22.860
So I'm not gonna show you how to do that.

05:22.860 --> 05:26.460
It's very simple and there's no point of wasting time on it.

05:26.460 --> 05:29.010
I already have the Trojan that shows a picture

05:29.010 --> 05:30.870
of the image right here.

05:30.870 --> 05:33.090
So I'm just gonna click on share

05:33.090 --> 05:34.590
to get the link for it,

05:34.590 --> 05:36.573
and I'm gonna click on copy link.

05:38.160 --> 05:40.140
Now let me show you this trick.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.773
If I just go in a new tab

05:41.773 --> 05:44.880
and paste my download link,

05:44.880 --> 05:46.200
you'll see that the file

05:46.200 --> 05:48.720
will not be automatically downloaded.

05:48.720 --> 05:50.520
I'll first go to Dropbox

05:50.520 --> 05:51.353
and then the user

05:51.353 --> 05:54.540
will have to click on download to download it.

05:54.540 --> 05:57.150
But if we modify the URL

05:57.150 --> 06:01.020
and just put a one in here instead of the zero,

06:01.020 --> 06:03.090
and if I hit enter,

06:03.090 --> 06:05.490
you'll see it'll automatically

06:05.490 --> 06:08.400
download the file for the user.

06:08.400 --> 06:10.860
And this is exactly what I want.

06:10.860 --> 06:13.200
Therefore I'm just gonna go down now

06:13.200 --> 06:15.663
and paste the file in here.

06:16.980 --> 06:17.813
And that's it.

06:17.813 --> 06:19.020
Now, if we hit enter,

06:19.020 --> 06:22.350
this message will be sent and delivered to the target,

06:22.350 --> 06:27.350
but it's gonna say m.askar@isecurity.org in here,

06:28.110 --> 06:29.820
while actual messages

06:29.820 --> 06:31.470
that come from this person

06:31.470 --> 06:33.480
display the person's name.

06:33.480 --> 06:34.740
As you can see in here,

06:34.740 --> 06:37.380
they will actually say Mohammad Askar,

06:37.380 --> 06:39.120
but don't worry about this.

06:39.120 --> 06:41.190
In the next lecture I'm gonna teach you

06:41.190 --> 06:44.340
how to use advanced options to do that

06:44.340 --> 06:47.823
and set the sender name to anything that you want.
