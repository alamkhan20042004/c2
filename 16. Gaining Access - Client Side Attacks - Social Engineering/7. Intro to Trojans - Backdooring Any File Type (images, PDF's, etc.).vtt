00:00:01.091 --> 00:00:02.470
<v Instructor>In this lecture I'd like to show you</v>

2
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:06.020
how to combine the backdoor that we created before

3
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.820
with any other file type,

4
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.420
so that, when executed,

5
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.033
it'll display an image,

6
00:00:11.033 --> 00:00:12.100
a PDF,

7
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.933
a song,

8
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:16.540
or something that the target person is interested in.

9
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.610
This way, you'll be able to social-engineer them

10
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.160
to run your backdoor

11
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.750
and they'll see something that they trust,

12
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:24.960
but at the same time,

13
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.170
your backdoor will run in the background.

14
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.640
We're gonna do this using a "download and execute script"

15
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.880
which will basically download the backdoor,

16
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.700
download the file that the person expects,

17
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.740
run the file that the person expects

18
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.083
and run the backdoor in the background.

19
00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.180
I'm gonna include the download and execute script

20
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.610
in the resources,

21
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.260
but I already have it downloaded here.

22
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.590
So, you can literally just double-click this

23
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.623
and you'll see the code used inside the script.

24
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.100
I programmed this in a way,

25
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.670
so that you can use it to download and execute

26
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.270
anything and any number of files.

27
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.520
So, all you have to do,

28
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.690
is literally put the links or the URLs for the files in here

29
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.330
and separate them by a comma.

30
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.690
So, you can out URL-comma, URL-comma and keep going.

31
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.620
So, you can use this to download and execute

32
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.880
two executable, three executable,

33
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.823
or any number of files you want.

34
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.310
So, I'm gonna delete everything here

35
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.950
and I'm gonna put the file

36
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.460
that I want the target person to see.

37
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.070
Now, this file needs to be available online

38
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.220
and uploaded on a direct link

39
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.520
so it can be downloaded form that link.

40
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.670
For this example, I'm gonna use an image,

41
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.660
but you can use any other file type.

42
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.480
You can get them to open a PDF

43
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.990
or anything else that you want.

44
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.830
So, I'm just gonna go on my browser

45
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.810
and I'm gonna go on Google Images

46
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.060
and just look for an image.

47
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.510
And I'm gonna look for a car.

48
00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.770
I'm gonna take the car image

49
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.380
and I'm gonna click on "view image" here.

50
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.480
And notice when I do that, we get the image itself

51
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.490
through a direct URL right here.

52
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.640
So, you can see the end of the URL is dot GPG

53
00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.610
and when we access the image,

54
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.710
you'll see that there is no ads around it, nothing, no HTML.

55
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.510
All you see is just the file itself.

56
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.390
So, the files included in that script,

57
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.683
all have to have a direct URL.

58
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.360
So, I'm gonna copy all of this

59
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.113
and I'm gonna paste it in here as the first URL.

60
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.930
Now, this is done.

61
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.740
The next file that I wanted to be downloaded and executed

62
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.500
is gonna be my backdoor.

63
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.010
So, I'm gonna put a comma

64
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.360
and then I'm gonna put a direct URL for my backdoor.

65
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.210
And as we've seen before, that's toward at HTTP,

66
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.256
10, 20,

67
00:02:54.256 --> 00:02:55.690
14 to 13,

68
00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.957
evil files, rev HTTP, S-A-T-A-T dot EXE.

69
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.460
Now, just to go over this point again.

70
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.060
If I copy this URL

71
00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.070
and paste it in my browser,

72
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.230
you'll see that I can download this,

73
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.080
I can access the backdoor and download it,

74
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.810
without seeing any HTML,

75
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.420
without seeing any timer or download-page.

76
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.910
Literally, if I paste that URL in there,

77
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.660
I can access the file and download it directly.

78
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.190
You can see that there's no pages loaded, nothing.

79
00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.890
If I put the URL, I can download the file.

80
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.310
This is very, very important.

81
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.010
The script will not work if you don't use direct URLs.

82
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.320
So, as you can see,

83
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.650
the script is very simple.

84
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.780
All we had to do is, put he URL for the first file

85
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.320
and then we put a comma,

86
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.710
which is very, very important, again.

87
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.300
So, you have to separate the URLs by a comma.

88
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.490
And then we put the URL for the second file.

89
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.660
And like I said, if you want to download more files,

90
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.530
if you wanna download more backdoor or more evil-files,

91
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.740
all you have to do is just put another comma

92
00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.620
and put the next URL.

93
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.090
Now, this is not a programming course,

94
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.750
so I'm not gonna explain how I program the script,

95
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:10.920
it's very simple.

96
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.970
Basically, all it's gonna do is,

97
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.460
it's gonna download these files

98
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.060
and then execute them.

99
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.183
And I have the download function in here.

100
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.060
Now, everything is ready for me.

101
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.423
I'm gonna save this and close it.

102
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.480
I'm just gonna go back to my downloads to see the script.

103
00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.290
And now, all we have to do,

104
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.990
is compile the script to an "executable".

105
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.913
And I'm gonna show you how to do that in the next lecture.
