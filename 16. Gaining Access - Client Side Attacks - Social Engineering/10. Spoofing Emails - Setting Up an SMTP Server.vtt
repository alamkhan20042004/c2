00:00.947 --> 00:02.280
Instructor: In the previous videos,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.680
we learned how to create a Trojan

00:04.680 --> 00:06.900
by backdooring normal files,

00:06.900 --> 00:11.610
such as images, documents, songs, and so on,

00:11.610 --> 00:15.840
so that when executed, the user sees the normal file,

00:15.840 --> 00:17.730
but at the same time,

00:17.730 --> 00:21.513
our evil code gets executed in the background.

00:23.070 --> 00:26.790
So the challenge now is how to deliver the Trojan

00:26.790 --> 00:28.350
to the target.

00:28.350 --> 00:31.080
The first delivery method that we're gonna talk about,

00:31.080 --> 00:35.160
and my personal favorite, is the mail delivery.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.360
Now, this delivery method,

00:36.360 --> 00:38.790
just like any other delivery methods,

00:38.790 --> 00:41.730
relies on the information that you gathered so far.

00:41.730 --> 00:44.700
So information gathering is very, very important

00:44.700 --> 00:46.350
when it comes to this.

00:46.350 --> 00:48.059
This delivery method is really handy

00:48.059 --> 00:51.750
because you can use it in so many scenarios.

00:51.750 --> 00:54.090
You can use it to deliver all the back doors

00:54.090 --> 00:56.670
and the evil files that we see so far.

00:56.670 --> 00:59.520
You can use it to pretend to be a friend

00:59.520 --> 01:02.670
and contact your friend and tell him to download something.

01:02.670 --> 01:05.430
You can use it to pretend to be a website

01:05.430 --> 01:07.830
that the target website interacts with

01:07.830 --> 01:10.380
and pretend to be the admin of the other website

01:10.380 --> 01:12.510
and ask the target to do something.

01:12.510 --> 01:15.600
You can pretend to be a member of the support team

01:15.600 --> 01:17.850
that the target website uses,

01:17.850 --> 01:20.250
and then ask them to change their password, for example,

01:20.250 --> 01:22.560
for the web server that they're using.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.720
You can use it to pretend to be a company

01:24.720 --> 01:27.270
that your target interacts with

01:27.270 --> 01:29.790
and tell them that there's a new update of your software

01:29.790 --> 01:31.350
that they already use,

01:31.350 --> 01:34.290
and then get them to download and install a backdoor.

01:34.290 --> 01:36.930
So the possibilities are limitless, really,

01:36.930 --> 01:39.390
when it comes to mail delivery.

01:39.390 --> 01:40.223
In this lecture,

01:40.223 --> 01:42.660
I'm gonna show you an example of targeting a person

01:42.660 --> 01:43.860
that's called Zaed.

01:43.860 --> 01:46.770
Zaed could be just a normal person that you want to hack.

01:46.770 --> 01:49.320
He could be a friend of a person that you want to hack,

01:49.320 --> 01:50.610
but you want to hack Zaed first

01:50.610 --> 01:52.200
and then hack to that person.

01:52.200 --> 01:54.660
He could be the admin of a website,

01:54.660 --> 01:57.030
or he could be an employee of a company.

01:57.030 --> 01:58.260
It really doesn't matter.

01:58.260 --> 02:00.846
What we're looking at in this lecture is hacking a person

02:00.846 --> 02:02.400
that's called Zaed.

02:02.400 --> 02:03.420
And then from there,

02:03.420 --> 02:06.780
you can leverage that person to hack into other systems

02:06.780 --> 02:10.020
or into other networks or into a different company.

02:10.020 --> 02:12.360
And I have the information that we gathered already

02:12.360 --> 02:15.120
in our information gathering lecture,

02:15.120 --> 02:17.010
and after we gathered everything,

02:17.010 --> 02:21.420
we managed to see that Zaed has a number of friends in here.

02:21.420 --> 02:25.710
And the same friends, we managed to see their emails here.

02:25.710 --> 02:27.210
And we managed to get Zaed's email,

02:27.210 --> 02:29.760
which is zaed@isecurity.org.

02:29.760 --> 02:31.710
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna pretend

02:31.710 --> 02:33.750
to be one of these guys.

02:33.750 --> 02:38.160
So m.askar@isecurity.org, and it's this person in here.

02:38.160 --> 02:40.170
His name is Mohammad Askar.

02:40.170 --> 02:42.690
So we're gonna pretend to be that person.

02:42.690 --> 02:44.520
We're gonna send an email to Zaed

02:44.520 --> 02:45.570
and the email's gonna look

02:45.570 --> 02:47.760
as if it's coming from this person,

02:47.760 --> 02:50.973
and then we're gonna ask Zaed to download a file.

02:51.990 --> 02:53.190
Let's see how this works.

02:53.190 --> 02:55.950
And this is gonna be a more realistic delivery method

02:55.950 --> 02:58.830
that you can actually use in real life.

02:58.830 --> 03:01.110
Now, there are a number of ways to do this.

03:01.110 --> 03:03.690
The easiest is just to go on Google

03:03.690 --> 03:07.080
and look for spoof emails online.

03:07.080 --> 03:10.530
You'll see a lot of websites that will allow you to do this.

03:10.530 --> 03:13.740
The only problem with these websites is the email

03:13.740 --> 03:17.670
that you're going to send will end up in the spam directory

03:17.670 --> 03:19.080
of the target person,

03:19.080 --> 03:22.470
so it will not be delivered into their inbox,

03:22.470 --> 03:24.450
which is not great.

03:24.450 --> 03:26.610
The main reason for this is,

03:26.610 --> 03:28.890
because these websites are public,

03:28.890 --> 03:31.890
and a lot of people use them for spamming,

03:31.890 --> 03:36.060
mail servers such as Google, Hotmail and Yahoo

03:36.060 --> 03:38.370
have blacklisted these servers,

03:38.370 --> 03:40.920
and any email that comes from the servers

03:40.920 --> 03:45.510
that these websites use will be marked as spam.

03:45.510 --> 03:47.790
Therefore, in order to bypass this,

03:47.790 --> 03:49.950
you can either use your own server,

03:49.950 --> 03:52.470
if you already have a web hosting plan,

03:52.470 --> 03:55.290
or you can sign up for a free web hosting plan

03:55.290 --> 03:58.020
and use that to send your fake emails.

03:58.020 --> 04:01.211
Or an even better solution is to sign up

04:01.211 --> 04:04.923
for an SMTP or a mail server.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.020
Now again, there are a number of websites that offer this.

04:10.020 --> 04:12.870
A lot of them are paid, but with the paid websites,

04:12.870 --> 04:15.420
you'll actually get really, really good results

04:15.420 --> 04:18.150
because they are used by actual marketers

04:18.150 --> 04:20.970
and by actual companies to send emails.

04:20.970 --> 04:24.180
So spam is never sent through these servers.

04:24.180 --> 04:27.180
If you look through Google for a free SMTP server

04:27.180 --> 04:30.390
or a free mail server, you will find some websites,

04:30.390 --> 04:33.270
and an example of this, this one right here.

04:33.270 --> 04:35.490
And this is also a really, really good website

04:35.490 --> 04:37.590
because it is a paid website,

04:37.590 --> 04:39.930
but they offer a free plan,

04:39.930 --> 04:43.320
which we can use to send our fake emails.

04:43.320 --> 04:47.190
Again, this website is designed for email marketing

04:47.190 --> 04:48.960
and for actual companies

04:48.960 --> 04:51.390
to communicate with their customers.

04:51.390 --> 04:54.990
So when you send emails through the servers of this website,

04:54.990 --> 04:57.060
they will not be marked as spam,

04:57.060 --> 05:00.720
because it's very rarely used for spam.

05:00.720 --> 05:05.310
So we're gonna sign up with this website, input my email,

05:05.310 --> 05:09.213
and I'm gonna set a password and create the account.

05:11.550 --> 05:14.890
Now I'm gonna go to the email that I used when I signed up

05:16.110 --> 05:18.930
and you'll see that we got a welcome message

05:18.930 --> 05:21.270
and I'm gonna confirm my email address

05:21.270 --> 05:22.803
to activate my account.

05:23.760 --> 05:25.590
Now it's asking me for more questions.

05:25.590 --> 05:29.190
So it's asking for my first name, last name, company name,

05:29.190 --> 05:32.250
phone number, company, website, and so on.

05:32.250 --> 05:34.650
You don't have to fill this very accurately,

05:34.650 --> 05:36.843
I'm just gonna use any information for it.

05:38.010 --> 05:41.100
Just make sure you put a correct phone number

05:41.100 --> 05:44.220
because they will send a verification code

05:44.220 --> 05:46.290
to this phone number.

05:46.290 --> 05:49.020
Now it's asking us for the verification code.

05:49.020 --> 05:51.273
I have it here on my phone number.

05:52.740 --> 05:56.280
And finally it's asking us to select the plan.

05:56.280 --> 05:58.650
Like I said, the free one is fine,

05:58.650 --> 06:02.673
unless you want to send a lot of emails on the same day.

06:04.260 --> 06:06.090
And that's it. We're good to go.

06:06.090 --> 06:07.080
In the next lecture,

06:07.080 --> 06:10.980
I will show you how to use the SMTP servers

06:10.980 --> 06:15.213
offered by this website in order to send fake emails.
