00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.230
<v Tutor>Now in this lecture,</v>

2
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.610
I'd like to give you an overview of a tool

3
00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.540
that we're gonna be using often in this course.

4
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.240
This tool is great for information gathering

5
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.620
and allows you to gather information just about anything.

6
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.520
You can gather information about people,

7
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.990
you can gather information about websites, computers,

8
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.020
companies, phone, numbers, everything,

9
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.090
really everything you can think of.

10
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.700
You can add to this tool

11
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.833
and try to extract information related to that entity,

12
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.010
The tool is called Maltego

13
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.740
and it's gonna become your best friend

14
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.410
when it comes to information gathering.

15
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.243
Now, like I said,

16
00:00:37.243 --> 00:00:40.270
the tool can be used to gather information about anything,

17
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.210
but using the tool is the same.

18
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.280
So it doesn't matter if your target is a website,

19
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.650
if it's a person, if it's a phone number, if it's a company,

20
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:49.900
it doesn't really matter.

21
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.370
Using the tool is exactly the same

22
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.571
but only the information that you'll be getting

23
00:00:54.571 --> 00:00:56.380
is gonna be different.

24
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.213
So in this lecture,

25
00:00:57.213 --> 00:00:59.530
we're gonna have a quick overview over this tool,

26
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.240
and then we're gonna be using it more

27
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.320
in the next lectures.

28
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.370
So, first of all, to run the tool,

29
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.903
just go to the more applications right here,

30
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.573
and then just type in, Maltego.

31
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.090
And you can see that the tool comes up in here

32
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.943
and it's called maltegoce.

33
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.740
The first time you're on the tool,

34
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.320
you'll be asked to login with a username and a password.

35
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.380
If you don't have one,

36
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.410
you'll have to register through the wizard that you'll see.

37
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.570
So just create a new username a new password

38
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.820
and then they'll send you an activation link to your email,

39
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:34.950
activate your account,

40
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.503
and then you'll be able to login and use the tool.

41
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.263
Now, as you can see,

42
00:01:39.263 --> 00:01:41.410
I've already logged in and it's offering me

43
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.910
to use one of the already made templates

44
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.350
for gathering information.

45
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.760
I'm not gonna use any of that,

46
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.880
so I'm just gonna click on the Cancel right here.

47
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.700
In here you can see that we have the homepage

48
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.950
for the tool.

49
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.710
And from here, you can add more transformers to the tool.

50
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.360
Basically transformers are plugins

51
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.520
that allow you to gather information about specific things.

52
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.420
So you can literally just click on Install on any of these,

53
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.190
and it'll add basically more transformers

54
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.790
or more things that you can do with Maltego.

55
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.250
A lot of these extra transformers will ask you to login

56
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.350
with the username and a password or use a certain API.

57
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.150
For now, we're just gonna use the built-in transformers.

58
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.150
And I'm just gonna go on right here to create a new graph.

59
00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.770
And this is the main workplace of Maltego.

60
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.140
So in the middle, we have our graph.

61
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.100
So here is where you're gonna be seeing your entities,

62
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.490
where you're gonna be seeing the information.

63
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.680
In here you'll have an overview of the graph,

64
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.920
and in here you'll have details about each entity

65
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.390
in the graph.

66
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.100
And in here at the bottom right

67
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.075
you'll be able change the properties

68
00:03:00.075 --> 00:03:02.610
for each of these entities.

69
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.534
All of this is empty now on all of this is vague

70
00:03:04.534 --> 00:03:07.790
I know for you, but once we start using the tool,

71
00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.893
it'll start making sense straight away.

72
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.840
On the left, we have our entities.

73
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.150
They're organized in categories right here,

74
00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.580
depending on the type of these entities.

75
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.960
So for example, if we click on the Infrastructure,

76
00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.100
it'll allow you to add a domain name,

77
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.240
you can add MX records, you can add URLs,

78
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.210
or you can add a website.

79
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.190
So you can literally just drag and drop

80
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.563
the entity that you want.

81
00:03:39.167 --> 00:03:41.460
And now we have our website in the graph.

82
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:42.430
And from here,

83
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.853
we can start gathering information about this website.

84
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.100
There's a lot of different types of entities,

85
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.540
so you can add a device from here.

86
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.650
You can, for example, if we go to Personal,

87
00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.960
you'll see that you can actually just add the person.

88
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.860
So literally you can just add the person,

89
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.080
give their first name, their second name,

90
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.060
and then you'll be able

91
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.653
to gather information about this person.

92
00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:11.270
You can also add a phone number,

93
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:12.590
again, put the phone number

94
00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.540
and start gathering information about it.

95
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.100
And one of the really cool categories right here

96
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.070
is the social links,

97
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.000
which will allow you to add Facebook entities.

98
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.770
It'll allow you add GitHub, Foursquare, LinkedIn, Instagram,

99
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.000
and other social networks.

100
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.670
And with that, once you add them,

101
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.470
you'll be able to gather information about these entities.

102
00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.800
And obviously this information will really help you

103
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.760
when it comes to trying to exploit that person

104
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.803
and hack into their system.

105
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.550
Now, once you add the entity in here,

106
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.610
if we click on the website, for example,

107
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.950
I'm just gonna go on the Property View.

108
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.410
And you'll see that in here,

109
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.880
I can modify the properties for this website.

110
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.590
So for example,

111
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.520
the first thing that we need to change

112
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.780
is put the name of our target website in here.

113
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.130
And once we do that,

114
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.620
we can right click and select what type of information

115
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:13.723
we want to gather.

116
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.230
Now I'm not gonna run any transformers in this video.

117
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:20.890
We're gonna do it in next videos.

118
00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.220
For now, I'm just showing you a quick overview of the tool,

119
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.220
how to add identities, how to run transformers.

120
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.673
And what do we mean by all of these things.

121
00:05:30.607 --> 00:05:33.000
I know a lot of this is still a bit vague,

122
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.070
but we're gonna be using this tool a lot in the course,

123
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.640
and it's gonna become very easy for you.

124
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.910
And as I said,

125
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.380
you're gonna be able to use it to gather information

126
00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.530
about anything.

127
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.960
And it's really gonna help you enhance

128
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.270
your social engineering skills.

129
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.030
Please note that right now

130
00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.510
you are using the free version of Maltego.

131
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:54.930
The free version is great

132
00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.460
at gathering all sorts of information,

133
00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.809
but it doesn't allow you to use search engines

134
00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:03.180
and a few other features.

135
00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.920
That's why in the next lectures,

136
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.600
I'm gonna be using the paid version.

137
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.860
You can actually request a free trial

138
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.780
from the link in the resources of this lecture.

139
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.200
Just explain to them that you are a student

140
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.900
and they'll happily give you trial access,

141
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.107
which you can use to do everything

142
00:06:20.107 --> 00:06:23.278
that I'm gonna show you in the next lectures.

143
00:06:23.278 --> 00:06:26.006
I know there are a lot of other free

144
00:06:26.006 --> 00:06:28.200
information gathering tools,

145
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.510
but in my opinion,

146
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.370
they do not even come close to Maltego.

147
00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.137
Maltego is the best at information gathering.

148
00:06:35.137 --> 00:06:39.740
And that's why I use it and I teach my students to use it.

149
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.850
Think of it this way, if you're learning how to design,

150
00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:45.810
would you rather learn how to do it using paint,

151
00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:46.870
which is free,

152
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.880
or would you want to use the best design software

153
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.263
such as Photoshop.
