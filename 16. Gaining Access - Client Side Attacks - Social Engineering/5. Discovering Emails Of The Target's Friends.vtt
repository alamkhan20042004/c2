1
00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.230
<v Instructor>Okay, now let's see what can we get</v>

2
00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.560
using the email of the target person?

3
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.880
Now if we hover over this

4
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.350
or if we just copy the email address,

5
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.220
it will copy the email of the person,

6
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.610
which is zaid@isecur1ty.org.

7
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.970
So we're gonna go back to our Maltego, and I'm gonna add,

8
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.623
I'm gonna put this to the side.

9
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.030
And we're gonna add a new entity,

10
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.280
and this is going to be an email address.

11
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.833
So we're gonna go to Personal,

12
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.000
and we're gonna look for Email Address.

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.083
Drag, drop that,

14
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.550
and set the email to the email

15
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.030
of the target person from the Properties.

16
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.390
Again, I'm gonna double-click it

17
00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.043
and type zaid@isecur1ty.org.

18
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.250
Now again, we actually got the email from here,

19
00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.970
from this icon right here,

20
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.290
which leads us to the email of the person.

21
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.340
So I didn't guess it myself or just get it out of nowhere.

22
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.160
I actually managed to get it

23
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.963
from only typing the name of the person.

24
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.660
Now from this email,

25
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.593
we're gonna try and see what information we can get.

26
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.223
I'm gonna right-click this, as usual,

27
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.990
and I'm gonna transfer this to a domain name.

28
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.840
Now again, you can transfer this to a person.

29
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.140
You can transfer this to a phone number,

30
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.110
to URLs, to websites.

31
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.380
But I'm not gonna do all of that

32
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.150
because I've already actually done this on my own time.

33
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.363
And the useful one is if we transfer it to a person.

34
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.460
So there is a lot of trial and error in this.

35
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.000
You'll try things.

36
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.010
It might not give you good information.

37
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.400
Delete the bad entities, and just keep going.

38
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.150
So we can see that we got a domain name,

39
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.700
which is isecur1ty.org.

40
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.280
Now from this website, I'm gonna try to get

41
00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.400
the email addresses associated to this website.

42
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.210
We're gonna go back,

43
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.190
and we're gonna look for email addresses,

44
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.293
as you can see here.

45
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.150
So I'm just gonna click on Run All

46
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.550
to run all the transformers that will get me email addresses

47
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.200
associated with this domain.

48
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.870
And if we go down, we have this domain protection email,

49
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:18.790
which is not useful,

50
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.150
so I'm just gonna delete it straight away.

51
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.370
And we have m.askar@isecur1ty.org,

52
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.403
which is the same person as this.

53
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.760
Now another thing that we can do from the domain

54
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.303
is transfer that to a website.

55
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.050
And then from this website,

56
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.303
we're gonna look for email addresses associated with it.

57
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.853
Great, now this is done.

58
00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.103
And if we go down,

59
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.670
we can see now we got two not-useful emails right here,

60
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.313
so I'm gonna delete these two.

61
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.283
And we have two good ones.

62
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.780
So we have mustafa@albazy.com,

63
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.670
which is the same as this person,

64
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.370
which we got from Twitter.

65
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.963
And we have the info@isecur1ty.org.

66
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.950
Now again, you can just keep going

67
00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.210
and try to gather more information about this target.

68
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.680
But for now, I think this is enough.

69
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.880
So we have enough info

70
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.290
to start building up an attack strategy for this person.

71
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.390
Now in the next lecture,

72
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.670
we'll discuss all the info that we gathered,

73
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.460
and we'll come up with ideas

74
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.650
on how we can attack this person

75
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.553
and hack into their system or into their accounts.
