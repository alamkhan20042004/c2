00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.450
<v Instructor>In the previous lecture,</v>

2
00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:04.309
we've seen how to use an SMTP server

3
00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:08.220
to spoof emails and make them appear like they're sent

4
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.820
from any other email address we want.

5
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.130
I also mentioned in the previous lecture

6
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.040
that there is another way of doing this

7
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.170
and that is using a web hosting.

8
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.480
Web hosting is simply a service

9
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.600
that allows us to cost files on the internet.

10
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.540
Therefore, we can use it to host our own website,

11
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.350
we can use it to share files

12
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.080
or we can even use the server resources

13
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.910
to send emails, as I'm gonna show you in this lecture.

14
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.930
So as you can see, learning how to set up

15
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.970
and use a web hosting can be useful

16
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.080
in many scenarios

17
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.170
and you can actually use it to do much more

18
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.370
than what I'm gonna show you here.

19
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.820
Now, if you look on Google,

20
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.430
you'll find a lot of free web hosting providers.

21
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.100
Unfortunately though, none of them allow you

22
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.750
to send emails.

23
00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.500
That's not really a big problem

24
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.830
because even paid web hosting plans

25
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.230
are very, very cheap.

26
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.081
You can look online for the cheapest

27
00:01:03.081 --> 00:01:05.350
and you can use any provider you want

28
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.280
because the steps that I'm gonna show you

29
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.440
will work with any provider.

30
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.040
But right here, I have a web hosting provider

31
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.290
called DreamHost.

32
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.640
They are pretty cheap and they work well.

33
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.783
So if we click on Get Started in here,

34
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.620
you'll see the cheapest plan is $2.95 per month.

35
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.500
So we're gonna click on Sign Up.

36
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.210
I'm gonna set this to monthly

37
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.700
and you'll notice the price will actually increase slightly,

38
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.300
so now it's $5 per month

39
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.200
instead of 2.95 if you paid for a year.

40
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.397
But that's fine.

41
00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:41.000
And I'm gonna say chose a domain later.

42
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.160
You'll only really need to use a domain

43
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.240
if you're hosting your own website.

44
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.030
The domain is what you see here on top

45
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.620
when it says, for example, dreamhost.com

46
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.590
or zsecurity.com but in our case,

47
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.423
we don't need that,

48
00:01:53.423 --> 00:01:55.803
so we're just gonna say choose a domain later.

49
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.160
And we're gonna select our payment method.

50
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.723
I'm gonna pay with PayPal.

51
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.970
Next, you have to put the billing address.

52
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:05.803
Now, you don't don't have

53
00:02:05.803 --> 00:02:07.470
to put correct information in here.

54
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.420
You can put whatever you want.

55
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.950
So I'm just gonna fill this randomly.

56
00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.690
Next, we have the account setup.

57
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.800
Make sure you put a valid email in here

58
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.210
because they will send you a confirmation.

59
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.820
So I'm gonna use my own email

60
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.060
and put a first name, last name, phone number.

61
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.210
Again, it doesn't have to be real.

62
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.970
We're gonna uncheck this to not receive marketing.

63
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.600
We don't want WordPress installed,

64
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.280
so we're unchecking this.

65
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.170
We don't want protection, so we're unchecking this.

66
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.740
And we don't want the email service that they provide,

67
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.630
so we're unchecking this

68
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.940
because we're actually gonna rely on PHP

69
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.760
to send the email using the mail function in PHP.

70
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.370
So we're basically unchecking everything.

71
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.080
We're going for the most basic plan they have

72
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.513
and we're just gonna click on Submit Order.

73
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.270
Now, the sign up might be slightly different

74
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.040
if you're using a different providers

75
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.650
but the steps are very simple

76
00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.890
and it's more or less the same.

77
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.773
It's asking us to set a password now.

78
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.293
And we're gonna continue to our control panel.

79
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.940
And perfect, now we have a web hosting plan

80
00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.180
that we can use to host our own websites,

81
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.800
host our own files if you wanted

82
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.370
to deliver back doors and such

83
00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.720
to your targets

84
00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.960
or you can use it to send fake emails,

85
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.280
as I'm gonna show you.

86
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.380
Now, again, using this dashboard

87
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.750
might be slightly different

88
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.370
depending on the provider that you have

89
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.340
but you'll notice that the steps are pretty much the same.

90
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.450
You wanna first access your management page

91
00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:39.290
for the website.

92
00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.230
So you can see in here,

93
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.830
it's giving us this button called Manage My Website.

94
00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.500
We can see this is our website right now

95
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.170
but it's saying it unavailable

96
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.720
'cause it's still being set up.

97
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.520
So we're gonna give it its time to set up

98
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.823
and we'll resume the video once it's ready.

99
00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.730
Okay, so now that the website is ready

100
00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.150
and we can see a preview of it here,

101
00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.380
we simply click on it to actually access it.

102
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.480
As you can see right now,

103
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.204
this is the URL for our website

104
00:04:05.204 --> 00:04:07.640
and you can see it's a simple website

105
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.560
that has nothing that tells you you should go

106
00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.890
to the admin to add stuff to this website.

107
00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.870
So back to the management page.

108
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.250
We're gonna click on Manage.

109
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.610
And depending on which provider you have,

110
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.840
you wanna look for the File Manager.

111
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.870
So in my case, you can see in here,

112
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.370
it's saying Manage Files

113
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.890
and if we click on the Manage in here,

114
00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.400
we're gonna get our File Manager.

115
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.870
From here, you wanna navigate to a directory

116
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.500
that is called public.html

117
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.468
or a directory that has the name

118
00:04:37.468 --> 00:04:40.400
of your website as we have in here.

119
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.850
So this is actually the name that I signed up with.

120
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.280
It's gibberish but that's what I actually set it to.

121
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.310
So we're just gonna click on it.

122
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.300
This is the directory where you should upload your files.

123
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.670
So if you're hosting a website,

124
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.970
you should upload the website files here.

125
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.300
Or if you're sharing files,

126
00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.650
then you should upload them in here as well

127
00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.310
or in our case, we wanna send fake emails,

128
00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.100
so we're gonna upload the PHP file

129
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.690
that we're gonna use to send the emails to this location.

130
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.890
Now, the file is in the resources of this lecture.

131
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.010
So download it.

132
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.550
I have it already downloaded in here.

133
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:15.907
And as you can see in the file name,

134
00:05:15.907 --> 00:05:19.763
you're gonna have to rename this file to send.php

135
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.149
because I can't upload PHP files,

136
00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:27.620
that's why I uploaded it in TXT format.

137
00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.850
So we're gonna go up again

138
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.280
and you're gonna need to find the Upload button.

139
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.150
In my case, it's in here.

140
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.930
I'm gonna click on it.

141
00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.130
Upload File and select the file that I wanna upload,

142
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.283
which is in my Downloads and it's this file right here.

143
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.370
I'm gonna double click it

144
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.677
and we have the file right here, send.php.

145
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.130
So all we have to do now

146
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.160
is go to the website

147
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.393
and I have it opened in this tab in here.

148
00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.900
And we're gonna put a forward slash

149
00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.600
after the website name.

150
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.253
And type the file name, which is send.php.

151
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.510
So using this is very simple.

152
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.710
All you have to do is set the email

153
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.090
that you want to send this email to

154
00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.700
and just to switch it up,

155
00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.810
I'm gonna send this to my other email,

156
00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.663
which is zaid@zsecurity.org.

157
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.540
Next, we're gonna set the from email,

158
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.480
this is the email that this email will appear

159
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.120
like it's coming from.

160
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.730
So again, just to change things around,

161
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.100
we're gonna set the from email this time

162
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.700
to adrian@zsecurity.org.

163
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.130
Now again, when you're setting the from email,

164
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.150
make sure that you set it to an email

165
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.840
that actually exists

166
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.080
and make sure that your target actually receives emails

167
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.470
from this email and communicates with them.

168
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.500
This will ensure that the email will land

169
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.150
in the inbox and it will also increase the chances

170
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:58.130
of your target of opening the email and interacting with it.

171
00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.350
Adrian works with me in the same company.

172
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.920
We frequently exchange emails,

173
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.033
therefore, this is a really good from email to spoof.

174
00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.940
The next field is the name field.

175
00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.640
This is similar to the from header

176
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.770
that we set manually in the previous lecture.

177
00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.210
So let me go to my inbox

178
00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.190
to show you where this name shows up.

179
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.020
Right here, I have an actual email

180
00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.620
that it got from Adrian.

181
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.810
And this part right here is the name.

182
00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:26.910
So whatever you set in here

183
00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:29.540
will be displayed in that part.

184
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.040
If you don't set that up,

185
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.530
it will automatically be set to the email

186
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.540
and it will appear like this one,

187
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.060
which is not identical to the real one

188
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.463
that I can get from him.

189
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.003
So we're gonna set this to Adrian's name.

190
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:46.400
We're gonna set the subject

191
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.176
and let's just set the subject of this to Test

192
00:07:49.176 --> 00:07:51.490
and we're just gonna set the body

193
00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:56.490
to this is another email spoofing test.

194
00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.210
Now, I don't really need to send a back door in this.

195
00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:01.740
The whole point of this lecture

196
00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:05.463
is to show you another method of spoofing emails.

197
00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.470
So now that we're done with everything,

198
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.780
I'm gonna click on Submit to send the email

199
00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:14.670
and as you can see, it's saying email sent.

200
00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:17.490
So that means the email got sent and delivered.

201
00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:18.940
So let's go to the inbox.

202
00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:22.010
Let's see if it looks identical to the real one

203
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:24.250
and let's see if it actually get delivered

204
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:26.480
into our inbox.

205
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.400
So right here, I have my inbox

206
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.233
and as you can see,

207
00:08:30.233 --> 00:08:33.430
here, the bottom one is an actual email

208
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:34.710
that I got from Adrian.

209
00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:36.860
This is a real email from Adrian.

210
00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.760
You can see the name here correct.

211
00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.330
Similar to the name here.

212
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.530
If I stay hovering on the real email,

213
00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:45.808
as you can see, I'll get a card that shows his name,

214
00:08:45.808 --> 00:08:48.680
his email and his phone number

215
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.910
and if I hover over the spoofed one,

216
00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:52.730
again, I get the exact same card

217
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:54.860
because it's pulling this from my contacts.

218
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.164
So it's automatically populating this.

219
00:08:57.164 --> 00:08:59.680
If I go on the real email right here,

220
00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.340
again, you can see this is a real email by him.

221
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.350
You see the name, you see the profile

222
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:07.383
and you see the from is from Adrian Bude.

223
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:10.483
Now, let's go to the spoofed one.

224
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:13.120
Again, you have the picture,

225
00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.760
you have the name and if we look in here,

226
00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.410
you have the correct email,

227
00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:19.870
adrianbude@zsecurity.org.

228
00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:23.070
The only part that might look a little bit suspicious

229
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.453
is the fact that it's saying via this.

230
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:29.290
But a lot of people are not gonna pay attention to this

231
00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:32.840
and this is only displayed in Gmail.

232
00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.980
So we tested with Live.

233
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.960
This doesn't even show up on it

234
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.240
and even with Gmail,

235
00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.260
we have the correct profile picture,

236
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.860
we have the correct name,

237
00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:44.560
we have the correct email if you look in here

238
00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.110
and we even have the correct phone number.

239
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:49.850
So this is just another method

240
00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:51.740
to show you how to spoof emails

241
00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.620
in case the previous method didn't work

242
00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.550
or if you just didn't like it, you can try this one.

243
00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:00.510
Again, like I said, you can use any web hosting provider.

244
00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:03.060
You do not have to use this one that I used.

245
00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.520
You can try the free ones, you can try the paid ones

246
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.500
and like I said, you will get better results

247
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.700
with the paid ones.

248
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.910
The steps are pretty much the same.

249
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:13.400
The only difference might be the sign up process

250
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.580
and the process of uploading the file

251
00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:16.910
to the website.

252
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:18.200
But the idea is the same.

253
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.240
You sign up with a web hosting provider,

254
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.360
you upload the send.php file,

255
00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.330
you browse the .php file

256
00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:27.653
from your web browser and you use it to send the email.
