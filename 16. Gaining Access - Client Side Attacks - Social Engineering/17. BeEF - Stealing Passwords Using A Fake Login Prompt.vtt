00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.140
<v Instructor>Okay, now let's have a look</v>

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.360
on a social engineering plugin

3
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.550
that'll allow us to steal usernames and passwords

4
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.420
for accounts.

5
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.980
So basically the way this works is, it'll dim the screen

6
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.493
and it'll tell the person that,

7
00:00:15.493 --> 00:00:17.600
you got logged out of your session,

8
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.260
so please login to your account again

9
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.060
so you can get authenticated.

10
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.528
So this will allow us to bypass HTTPS, HSTS,

11
00:00:25.528 --> 00:00:29.730
all security that's used by the target account page.

12
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.360
For example, if you're trying to get username and password

13
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.130
for Facebook then you'll be able to bypass all the security

14
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.080
that Facebook uses. Because what you're doing is,

15
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.040
you're actually just showing a fake Facebook page.

16
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.730
So the user will never actually get in contact

17
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.563
with Facebook.

18
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.123
So let's just click on this.

19
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.750
And you'll see that you can click form form here,

20
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.350
you can click what account that you want to hijack.

21
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.070
So let's say we're going with Facebook

22
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.230
and you can select what the backlight will be.

23
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.320
So we're just leaving that as gray

24
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.093
and we're gonna execute this.

25
00:01:06.377 --> 00:01:08.480
And when we go to our target

26
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.300
you'll see that they're being told

27
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.290
that they go logged out of their session

28
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.010
so please login with your username and password.

29
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.073
So I'm gonna put my username as zaid.

30
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.403
Then I'm gonna put my password as 123456.

31
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.953
And Enter.

32
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.253
And if we go back here,

33
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.090
you'll see we got our username,

34
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.773
was zaid and the password was 123456.

35
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.960
So you can use this to hijack a number of accounts.

36
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.750
For example. Let's just have another example.

37
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.070
If we go with YouTube...

38
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.440
Again you give it an execute, come back,

39
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.060
you see the YouTube logo and you can try to login.

40
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.060
Put a username, password, sign in and that'll be captured.

41
00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.380
So again, this is a really good way of gaining access

42
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.350
to accounts.

43
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.810
Because even if the user is not planning on logging in

44
00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.780
to the account that you're trying to steal

45
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.350
then you'll kind of force them to enter their username

46
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.230
and password to be logged back in into their account.

47
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.330
And then you'll be able to capture the username

48
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.180
and the password.
