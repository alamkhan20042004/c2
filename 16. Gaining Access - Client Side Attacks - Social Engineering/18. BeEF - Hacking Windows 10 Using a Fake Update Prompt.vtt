1
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.690
<v Speaker>Okay, so let's see how we can gain full control</v>

2
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.000
and get a Meterpreter session from the target computer.

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.570
So, again we're gonna go on the commands

4
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.430
and we're gonna go on the social engineering.

5
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.300
Now, there's actually a number of ways

6
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.420
that you can use in here to get a reverse trail.

7
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.630
It all depends on how you wanna make

8
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.950
your social engineering attack.

9
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.900
What we're going to use, we're gonna use a notification bar,

10
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.050
a fake notification bar, and we're choosing Firefox

11
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.750
because our target is runs on Firefox

12
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.083
or are using Firefox.

13
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.450
So, what this will do, it will basically tell the user,

14
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.360
it'll display a notification bar telling the user that

15
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.130
there is a new update or there's a plugin

16
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.690
that you need to install.

17
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.340
Once they install the plugin,

18
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.240
then they'll actually install a backdoor

19
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.900
and you'll gain full access to their computer.

20
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.210
So, the way we're gonna do this is we're gonna use the same

21
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.970
backdoor that we always created and we've been using.

22
00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.220
Now, I actually have it stored in my web server.

23
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.123
So, I have it stored in var,

24
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.180
www.html and I have it called update.exe

25
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.057
but it's the same backdoor,

26
00:01:12.057 --> 00:01:15.613
the same reverse http Meterpreter that we used before.

27
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.680
So, I'm gonna give the full address to it here.

28
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.030
So, it's stored in

29
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.110
10.20.14.207,

30
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.290
that's my actual IP,

31
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.210
and the name of the file is update.exe

32
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.330
and then the notification, the notification

33
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.250
is just saying there is an additional plugin

34
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.240
that needs to be installed to display

35
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.740
some elements on this page.

36
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.380
Now, you can change this and just say,

37
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.283
critical update for Firefox,

38
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.643
click here to install.

39
00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.630
So, I'm gonna hit execute

40
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.470
and if we go on to target,

41
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.980
you can see that they're getting a message

42
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.350
telling them that there is a new update for Firefox

43
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.910
and click here to download and install.

44
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.170
So, the target person will be like,

45
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.630
oh yeah I need to install this.

46
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.650
So, they download it

47
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.922
and now basically they have a backdoor

48
00:02:16.922 --> 00:02:18.880
downloaded on their machine.

49
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.980
Once they try to run this backdoor to install the update,

50
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.260
they think it's an update, but they'll actually run

51
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.750
a backdoor which will give us full access to their computer.

52
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.120
Before I run the backdoor, I need to listen on the port,

53
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.800
exactly like we did it before,

54
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.870
so I'm just gonna do show options here to show you,

55
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.730
I'm not gonna go through all the steps.

56
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.430
It's using Metasploit multi handler,

57
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.000
saying why we did it in the video of listening for ports.

58
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.270
So, we're using Meterpreter reverse http,

59
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.730
I have my IP and the port,

60
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.313
so I'm just gonna do exploit,

61
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.610
and I'm listening for the connections now.

62
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.283
Now, let's run the update that we just downloaded.

63
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.730
And if we go on the target,

64
00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.070
you can see that we got full control over it

65
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.713
using a Meterpreter session.

66
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.670
Now, again

67
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.020
this is just an example of one way

68
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.540
of getting in full control over the target computer.

69
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.220
There's a number of ways that you can do

70
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.140
using beef and there is a number

71
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.930
of social engineering attacks that you can do

72
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.100
to gain full access on the target computer.

73
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.620
So, again I highly recommend you go over the plugins

74
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.480
and experiment with them and see

75
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.180
what attacks you can come up with.
