<v ->So far we have seen really good methods in</v>

2
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:05.730
client side attacks.

3
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.490
These, these methods were really good,

4
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.460
because they didn't, we didn't really ask

5
00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:11.840
the client to do anything.

6
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.790
We were, we would gain access to the target computer

7
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.000
if the client update their system

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.740
or if they download something,

9
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.940
then we will backdoor it on the fly.

10
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.330
So these methods are really good

11
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.600
because we don't really need to interact with,

12
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.960
like with, the person does need to do something.

13
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.290
So the user has to actually do an action

14
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.033
but we don't need to ask them to do something.

15
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.570
The only problem with these methods is

16
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.210
that we need to be the man in the middle.

17
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.653
So we either need to do ARP poisoning

18
00:00:38.653 --> 00:00:42.080
or we need start our own fake access point

19
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.653
or do something to become the man in the middle.

20
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.260
In the next videos we are going to talk about

21
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.670
a method or methods that you can use

22
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.410
if you aren't the man in the middle.

23
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.100
If the person maybe exists in a remote place

24
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.620
that you, like it's not possible for you to become

25
00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.664
the man in the middle.

26
00:00:58.664 --> 00:01:02.240
So we are going to be talking about social engineering.

27
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.560
And social engineering is really big and there are

28
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.890
so many attacks that you can do

29
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.470
because it all depends, sometimes you don't even need

30
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.800
any technical information to that kind of attacks.

31
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.720
So it all depends on your target and how you are

32
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.520
going to build a strategy to attack that target

33
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.407
and maybe get some passwords

34
00:01:20.407 --> 00:01:24.403
or gain access to certain computer system.

35
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.120
So what we are going to do is, usually with information

36
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.770
gathering, the most important step is gathering information.

37
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.600
You need to gather as much information as you can

38
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.600
about your target, about what websites they use,

39
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.407
who is their friends,

40
00:01:39.407 --> 00:01:42.450
anything, any piece of information can

41
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.540
become really really useful to you when

42
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.470
it comes to social engineering.

43
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.750
So we are going to look at how to gather information

44
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.693
about a specific person first.

45
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.470
So here all we have, all we a going to have

46
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.530
is just a name or a Facebook account

47
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.980
and we will see what information we can gather

48
00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.193
based on that name.

49
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.760
After that we are going to move

50
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.790
and we are going to start building a strategy

51
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.920
and we will see how we can use all the information

52
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.450
that we gathered to build a strategy

53
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.508
in order to build an attack and gain access

54
00:02:11.508 --> 00:02:14.280
to the target computer system

55
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.410
and at the end we are actually going to use

56
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.150
some technical stuff to create our backdoor.

57
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.490
We are going to make a back door that is acceptable

58
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.990
by the target user, that they will probably use.

59
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.970
And we will also see how we can pretend

60
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.990
to be one of their friends and get the target person

61
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.540
to run the back door

62
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.470
so we are actually going to be asking them

63
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.140
to run a specific file and serve the methods

64
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.090
we have seen so far, where the user goes and voluntarily

65
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.890
goes and updates their system

66
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.993
or downloads a certain executable.
