00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.060
<v ->Information gathering is one of the most important steps</v>

2
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.150
when it comes to hacking or penetration testing.

3
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:07.983
If you think of it,

4
00:00:07.983 --> 00:00:10.720
you can't really gain access to a system,

5
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.589
if you don't have enough information about it.

6
00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:14.752
So for example,

7
00:00:14.752 --> 00:00:18.150
let's say you're connected to a network and one of the

8
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.505
devices connected to this network is your target.

9
00:00:21.505 --> 00:00:23.497
Now for you to hack into that target,

10
00:00:23.497 --> 00:00:27.173
first, you need to discover all of the connected clients

11
00:00:27.173 --> 00:00:28.293
to this network,

12
00:00:28.293 --> 00:00:29.760
get their Mac address,

13
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.673
their IP address.

14
00:00:30.673 --> 00:00:31.947
And then from there,

15
00:00:31.947 --> 00:00:35.768
try to maybe gather more information or run some attacks in

16
00:00:35.768 --> 00:00:39.531
order to gain access to your target.

17
00:00:39.531 --> 00:00:40.364
Now,

18
00:00:40.364 --> 00:00:43.510
there are a number of programs that will do this for you.

19
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.210
Examples are Net Discover and EnMap,

20
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.440
which do this job really, really well.

21
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.199
So in this lecture, we'll start with the simpler one,

22
00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.660
which is Net Discover and see how to use it to quickly map

23
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.300
the network we're connected to.

24
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.810
And in the next lecture,

25
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.619
I'm going to show you how to use EnMap,

26
00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:05.532
to gather detailed information about all of the clients

27
00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:08.253
connected to the same network.

28
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.103
So I have my Cali terminal in here.

29
00:01:12.103 --> 00:01:14.720
And if I do, ifconfig,

30
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.664
you'll see, I have ETA zero,

31
00:01:16.664 --> 00:01:18.797
it has an IP address.

32
00:01:18.797 --> 00:01:20.084
And like I said,

33
00:01:20.084 --> 00:01:24.500
this is the virtual interface created by virtual box,

34
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.694
when we set the Cali machine to use an ad network.

35
00:01:28.694 --> 00:01:29.527
Now,

36
00:01:29.527 --> 00:01:33.290
I also said that this knot network behaves exactly like an

37
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.565
ethernet network.

38
00:01:34.565 --> 00:01:37.428
And as far as the Cali machine is concerned,

39
00:01:37.428 --> 00:01:41.870
it thinks that it is connected to our real wired network.

40
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.530
And as you can see in here it's telling me that wired

41
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.363
connected.

42
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.207
Now I have my virtual windows machine right here.

43
00:01:50.207 --> 00:01:54.581
It is configured to use the same Nat network as the Cali

44
00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:56.150
machine.

45
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.320
Remember, we're still in the network hacking section.

46
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.442
So both you and the target machine need to be connected to

47
00:02:03.442 --> 00:02:05.590
the same network.

48
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.620
So as far as these two computers are concerned,

49
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.665
they think that they are connected to the same network.

50
00:02:11.665 --> 00:02:15.690
So what I want to do right now is use Net Discover and see

51
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.430
how we can use it to discover all devices connected to the

52
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.363
same network.

53
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.373
Now,

54
00:02:22.373 --> 00:02:24.580
the method that I'm going to show you will work exactly the

55
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.413
same,

56
00:02:25.413 --> 00:02:27.720
whether you're using it against a virtual network like I'm

57
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.603
doing right now or against real network.

58
00:02:29.603 --> 00:02:33.783
And even if your target is a wifi or a wireless network.

59
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.320
So all you have to do is type the name of the program,

60
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.180
which is net discover and then type dash R

61
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.180
or to specify an IP range to search for.

62
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.870
This needs to be arranged that can be accessed by you.

63
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.170
So right now you can see that my IP is 10 0 2 16,

64
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.170
and I can only access IPS on the same sub-net.

65
00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.050
So IP is on the same, sub-net start at 10 0 2 0.

66
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.920
And they would end at 10 0 2 2 5 4,

67
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.433
because 2, 5, 4 is the last IP that a client can have.

68
00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.570
So my range is going to be 10, zero, two one,

69
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.160
and I want to search for clients that might have an IP of

70
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.830
10 0 2 1, 10 0 2 2, 10 0 2 3,

71
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.023
all the way up to 10 0 2, 25, 4.

72
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.970
So instead of manually typing all of these IPS,

73
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.970
I can just type over 24 and net discover will automatically

74
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.480
know that I'm trying to search for all of the IPS that start

75
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.480
at 10 0 2 1 and end 10 0 2, 25, 4.

76
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.130
So this is a way of specifying an IP range for the whole

77
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.550
subnet.

78
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:53.943
So if I hit enter now,

79
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.380
you'll see that net discover will show me all the IPS of the

80
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.030
devices connected to the same network and note that the

81
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.530
first three parts of the IPS are always the same because

82
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.880
they are on the same sub-net.

83
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.910
And I also have the Mac addresses of these clients and Net

84
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.943
Discovers also attempting to guess the device vendor.

85
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.050
Now, if I press Q, this will quit the program.

86
00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:25.030
And right now we have a list of all the connected clients to

87
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.762
the same network.

88
00:04:26.762 --> 00:04:28.090
Now, like I said,

89
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.730
you can also use this method to discover clients connected

90
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.430
to the same wifi network.

91
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.412
The only thing is right now, if I do, ifconfig,

92
00:04:38.412 --> 00:04:42.385
you can see that my Cali machine does not have a wireless

93
00:04:42.385 --> 00:04:46.731
adapter, it's not connected to a wifi network.

94
00:04:46.731 --> 00:04:48.406
And like I said before,

95
00:04:48.406 --> 00:04:52.760
you cannot access the built in wireless card from a virtual

96
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.340
machine.

97
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.173
Therefore,

98
00:04:55.173 --> 00:04:58.810
if you want to do this or run any of the wireless attacks

99
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.880
that we're going to see in the future against a real

100
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.085
computer and a real wireless network,

101
00:05:04.085 --> 00:05:07.653
you're going to need to use a wireless adapter.

102
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.700
Now I'm going to include links in the description that will

103
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.680
help you pick a good adopter that works with Cali Linux.

104
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.530
But right now I actually have one and I'm just going to

105
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.120
connect it and use it just to prove to you.

106
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.680
If things work on the virtual machines,

107
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.738
connected to the virtual network,

108
00:05:25.738 --> 00:05:29.419
they will work exactly the same against a real network with

109
00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:31.810
real machines.

110
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.687
So I'm going to connect my adapter now.

111
00:05:34.687 --> 00:05:39.687
And if I do, if config, it's still not showing up,

112
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.450
let's see if it shows up now.

113
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:43.781
Perfect. As you can see,

114
00:05:43.781 --> 00:05:46.733
I have an adapter now called LAN zero.

115
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.440
And what I'm going to do is I need to connect this adapter

116
00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.813
to a wifi network first,

117
00:05:52.813 --> 00:05:56.900
before I can discover all the connected clients to this

118
00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:57.733
network.

119
00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.360
So I'm going to go to my network manager.

120
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.900
I'm going to click in here and you want to click on select

121
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.320
network, as you can see automatically.

122
00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.130
Now it's actually connected to a network. But,

123
00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.000
in your case,

124
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.870
you'd want to select the network and click on connect,

125
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.967
and then it'll ask you for the password.

126
00:06:16.967 --> 00:06:20.590
So now I'm actually connected. And you'll see if I do,

127
00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.667
ifconfig again, right now, LAN zero has

128
00:06:24.667 --> 00:06:26.433
an IP address.

129
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.290
So this means that it is connected to a network.

130
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:34.575
And this means that we can use it now with net discover.

131
00:06:34.575 --> 00:06:35.560
So again,

132
00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.410
I'm going to use the exact same command that I used before,

133
00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.740
just to show you and prove to you that if this works against

134
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.321
virtual machines, it'll work against real machines.

135
00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:48.081
And the only difference is going to be the IP.

136
00:06:48.081 --> 00:06:50.460
So I'm going to remove this IP.

137
00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.093
And as you can see right now, my IP is

138
00:06:52.093 --> 00:06:55.663
1 9 2 1 6 8 1 8.

139
00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.700
So therefore the range that I'm going to look for is going

140
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:04.700
to start at 1 9 2 1 6 8 8 1 1.

141
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.530
And I'm going to leave the over 24 here,

142
00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.220
because this will tell Net Discover

143
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:15.050
that I want to start at 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 1 and finish at

144
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.833
1 9 2 1 6 8 2 5 4.

145
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:20.693
So if I hit enter now,

146
00:07:22.785 --> 00:07:24.220
as you can see,

147
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.640
it's discovering all the connected clients,

148
00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.730
all their IP addresses all their Mac addresses,

149
00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.000
and it's guessing the manufacturer.

150
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.850
And you can see it's also discovering some Apple devices

151
00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:38.040
here. So as you can see,

152
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.723
it's working perfectly using the exact same command.

153
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.690
Now, I only did this just to show you that if things work

154
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:50.040
against virtual machines and I guess virtual networks,

155
00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.460
then they will work against real machines because these

156
00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:57.300
virtual machines and virtual networks are modeled over real

157
00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.680
machines. And as far as the machines are concerned,

158
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.353
they actually think they are real computers and real

159
00:08:03.353 --> 00:08:04.423
machines.
