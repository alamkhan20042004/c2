00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:01.850
<v Tutor>The second program</v>

2
00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.990
that we'll use for network mapping is Nmap.

3
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.740
Now in the previous lecture we use Netdiscover

4
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.860
and we've seen how nice it is to quickly discover

5
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.300
all the devices connected to our network,

6
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.820
see their MAC address and maybe get the vendor.

7
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.150
Nmap takes scanning to a whole new level.

8
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.960
It might be a little bit slower than Netdiscover,

9
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.450
but it'll show you much, much more information

10
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.730
about the target.

11
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.715
So you'll be able to see the open ports,

12
00:00:30.715 --> 00:00:33.510
you'll be able to see the running programs

13
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.160
or the running services on these open ports,

14
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.400
you'll be able to determine the computer name,

15
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.660
the operating system running on that computer.

16
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.030
If you're in a network,

17
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.380
you'll be able to discover all of the connected clients,

18
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.070
you'll be able to bypass security, bypass firewalls,

19
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.119
and so much more.

20
00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:55.310
Nmap is actually a huge tool

21
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.960
and there are books and complete courses done

22
00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.750
just to teach and Nmap.

23
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.490
The Nmap book would actually be a really good read

24
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.920
once you're done with this course.

25
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.660
Now, because this tool is huge,

26
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.630
we're not gonna be able to cover all of its uses,

27
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.463
but in this lecture,

28
00:01:10.463 --> 00:01:13.070
I'm gonna show you the basics of this tool,

29
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.970
how to use it to discover all of the connected clients

30
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.700
and see useful information about them.

31
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.580
And we'll actually use it more

32
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.423
when we get to the gaining access section.

33
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.160
We're actually going to be used in Zenmap,

34
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.493
which is the graphical user interface of Nmap.

35
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.139
So to run it in terminal, you just have to type Zenmap

36
00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:38.483
or you can find it under your applications menu.

37
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.040
Now, as you can see, it has a very, very simple interface.

38
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.650
The first thing that we see is the target input box.

39
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.940
In here, you can put your target.

40
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.730
You can scan any IP that you can reach,

41
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.150
whether it's a personal computer, whether it's a server,

42
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.300
whether it's an IP for a web server for a website,

43
00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.133
for example,

44
00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:01.190
that you want to discover all the open ports

45
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.730
and all the running services on it.

46
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.070
Or, like what we're going to do right now,

47
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.060
we can put a range similar to what we did with Netdiscover

48
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.200
and it'll scan this whole range,

49
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.200
discover all the live IPS

50
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.200
or the IPS of the connected machines on the same network

51
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.703
and display information about them.

52
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.860
Now we'll have a look on how to scan servers

53
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.660
in the gaining access section.

54
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.493
So for now,

55
00:02:27.493 --> 00:02:30.800
since we are still in the network hacking section,

56
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.180
we're gonna put a range

57
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.390
to discover all the connected clients

58
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.023
and see useful information about them.

59
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.330
So, right now I'm actually connected to my wireless network,

60
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.660
that's why I'm gonna specify the whole range

61
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:44.630
on that network.

62
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.470
And we've seen how to get that in the previous lecture.

63
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.057
So it's 192.168.1.1/24

64
00:02:54.353 --> 00:02:56.930
At the bottom, you can see the command.

65
00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.610
This is actually the Nmap command that will be executed

66
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.700
when I hit this Command button.

67
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.140
So like I said, Zenmap, what we're using right now

68
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.730
is just the graphical interface

69
00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.460
that will run this Nmap command in the background

70
00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.020
and show me the results.

71
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.420
So if you know a custom Nmap command you can put it here.

72
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.940
Or, if you just want to see Nmap in terminal,

73
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.240
you can literally copy this command, paste it in terminal,

74
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.980
and it'll give you the same results

75
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.243
that you would get if you run it here.

76
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.221
Alternatively, if you don't really know much about Nmap

77
00:03:29.221 --> 00:03:30.690
and its commands,

78
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.343
you can use one of their ID profiles in here.

79
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.250
So in this lecture,

80
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.580
we're actually gonna be using a number of these profiles

81
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.800
and we'll see the difference between them in terms of speed

82
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.433
and the information gathered.

83
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.930
So I'm gonna start with the Ping scan.

84
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.790
This is a very quick scan.

85
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.280
It literally just pings every possible IP in the range

86
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.510
and if it gets a response, it'll record this response

87
00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.450
and it'll show me the devices that gave me a response,

88
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.770
which means that these are the devices connected

89
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.220
to the network.

90
00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.780
Now, a lot of devices do not respond to ping requests

91
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.800
even if they are alive.

92
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.320
So the list that you'll get in this scan

93
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.846
might not include all the devices connected to your network.

94
00:04:16.846 --> 00:04:19.350
Now once the scan is done, as you can see,

95
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.940
we can see the list of all the connected devices in here.

96
00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.740
And in here, we can also see the MAC addresses

97
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.120
for each of these devices.

98
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.880
We also can see the vendor.

99
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.990
So for example we can see that the device

100
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.406
at 192.168.1.1 is a Cisco device.

101
00:04:35.406 --> 00:04:38.940
This is actually my router, and it is made by Cisco,

102
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.470
so this is correct.

103
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.960
So we can go ahead and start looking for exploits

104
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.053
in this device.

105
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.900
We can also see the 192.168.1.10 is a HTC device.

106
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.400
And again, this is a HTC phone, this is correct.

107
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.517
And since it's HTC,

108
00:04:54.517 --> 00:04:58.490
then we know that it's probably running on Android.

109
00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:59.323
So as you can see,

110
00:04:59.323 --> 00:05:02.770
we're getting more information about the connected clients.

111
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.770
Again, we can see the 192.168.1.12 is an Apple device.

112
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.543
So it could be a phone, a tablet or Mac.

113
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.340
We can see the next device is a Dell.

114
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.490
So again, it was a very quick scan, but as you can see,

115
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.397
it still gave us much more information

116
00:05:19.397 --> 00:05:22.483
than what we got from Netdiscover.

117
00:05:23.335 --> 00:05:26.213
The next scan that I wanna show you is the Quick scan.

118
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.560
Now this is gonna be slightly slower than the Ping scan

119
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.893
but it's gonna show us more information.

120
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.830
So right now you can see that the scan

121
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.690
is showing us the same information that we've seen before

122
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.530
with the ping scan,

123
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.450
but it's also showing us the open ports

124
00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.800
on each one of the discover devices.

125
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.220
So it's able to discover the following ports in the router,

126
00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.500
and we can see that port 80 is open.

127
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.880
This is actually the port used for the router settings page

128
00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.763
because it runs on a web server, so this is correct.

129
00:06:00.827 --> 00:06:03.050
Again, we have our Apple device here

130
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.740
that we said it might be a phone or a computer or a tablet,

131
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.080
but we can see now it has port 22 open.

132
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.340
So this is a port for a service called SSH,

133
00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.880
which is designed to allow remote access

134
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.723
to the system it's running on.

135
00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.170
Again, if you go on all the other devices,

136
00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.860
you can see all the open ports and the services running

137
00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.553
on each one of these ports.

138
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.090
Now, in the next lecture we'll build up on this,

139
00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.110
we'll see how to gather even more information.

140
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.750
And you'll see how important information gathering is

141
00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.180
because we're going to use the gathered information

142
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.560
to hack into an iPhone

143
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.963
that is connected to the same network.
