00:00.000 --> 00:01.860
Instructor: As mentioned in the previous lecture,

00:01.860 --> 00:04.620
installing Windows on Apple computers

00:04.620 --> 00:05.910
that use the ARM chips,

00:05.910 --> 00:09.090
the M1, M2, and so on, the M series, is different.

00:09.090 --> 00:11.640
So the method shown in the previous lecture will not work,

00:11.640 --> 00:13.320
and that's why we have this lecture

00:13.320 --> 00:15.690
to show you how to install Windows 11

00:15.690 --> 00:18.690
on Apple computers that use the ARM chips

00:18.690 --> 00:20.640
the M1, M2, and so on.

00:20.640 --> 00:22.620
If you already got Windows installed

00:22.620 --> 00:24.660
following the instructions in the previous lecture,

00:24.660 --> 00:26.100
then you can skip this lecture.

00:26.100 --> 00:27.480
You should only watch this lecture

00:27.480 --> 00:30.480
if you have not installed Windows yet as a virtual machine

00:30.480 --> 00:33.000
because you have an Apple computer

00:33.000 --> 00:37.620
that uses an ARM chip such as the M1, M2, and so on.

00:37.620 --> 00:38.453
So first of all,

00:38.453 --> 00:41.370
you're gonna need to download the Windows 11

00:41.370 --> 00:42.900
for ARM processors.

00:42.900 --> 00:45.540
You can download it from the resources of this lecture.

00:45.540 --> 00:48.180
As you can see, I already have it downloaded in here.

00:48.180 --> 00:51.780
It's in a 7-Zip format, so it's compressed.

00:51.780 --> 00:54.993
And in order to decompress it, we're gonna double click it,

00:56.370 --> 00:58.383
and give it some time to decompress.

00:59.310 --> 01:02.490
And perfect, now that the decompression is complete,

01:02.490 --> 01:05.490
we have a new file in here, and as you can see,

01:05.490 --> 01:08.250
the extension is .vmwarevm

01:08.250 --> 01:11.940
which is basically a ready virtual machine for VMware.

01:11.940 --> 01:15.060
Now, we've already covered how to install VMware previously,

01:15.060 --> 01:17.520
so if you don't know or if you haven't done it already,

01:17.520 --> 01:19.080
just go back and revise it.

01:19.080 --> 01:22.140
So all I'm gonna do is simply double click the file

01:22.140 --> 01:24.420
to open it in VMware.

01:24.420 --> 01:25.710
Click on I Copied It

01:25.710 --> 01:28.230
because I created this virtual machine for you,

01:28.230 --> 01:30.723
and now the virtual machine is gonna start.

01:31.980 --> 01:33.600
And perfect, as you can see,

01:33.600 --> 01:36.870
we are logged in into our Windows 11 computer

01:36.870 --> 01:40.740
which is running as a virtual machine inside VMware player

01:40.740 --> 01:43.560
inside my Apple silicon computer.

01:43.560 --> 01:45.720
So if I go ahead here on the right

01:45.720 --> 01:48.240
and click on the virtual machine library,

01:48.240 --> 01:51.030
as you can see I have Kali installed in here,

01:51.030 --> 01:53.760
and now I have Windows which I can run

01:53.760 --> 01:55.770
by simply clicking on start,

01:55.770 --> 01:58.653
but right now it's already running, so I can't stop it.

01:59.730 --> 02:02.820
So I'm gonna close this, and as you can see,

02:02.820 --> 02:05.790
and here it's saying it is not connected to the internet,

02:05.790 --> 02:09.750
because we need to install the VMware tools on it

02:09.750 --> 02:13.050
which will install the drivers for the virtual interfaces

02:13.050 --> 02:15.120
so that we can access virtual networks,

02:15.120 --> 02:17.640
and it'll also install the display drivers

02:17.640 --> 02:20.280
and enable a lot of usability features.

02:20.280 --> 02:23.310
To do that, we're gonna go to the virtual machine here,

02:23.310 --> 02:26.820
and we're gonna click Reinstall VMware Tools.

02:26.820 --> 02:28.203
We're gonna click Install,

02:29.310 --> 02:33.330
and this will basically mount a DVD drive on this computer.

02:33.330 --> 02:36.270
And as you can see, we have a notification in here

02:36.270 --> 02:39.510
telling us that a new DVD drive is detected,

02:39.510 --> 02:42.420
and it's asking me what do I want to do?

02:42.420 --> 02:44.227
I'm gonna click it and I'm gonna say,

02:44.227 --> 02:46.350
"Open the folder for me, please."

02:46.350 --> 02:48.270
I'm gonna scroll down,

02:48.270 --> 02:50.940
and we're gonna use this setup script in here

02:50.940 --> 02:52.680
to install the tools.

02:52.680 --> 02:54.570
So I'm gonna right click it

02:54.570 --> 02:56.613
and choose to run it with PowerShell.

02:57.540 --> 02:58.440
It's gonna ask you

02:58.440 --> 03:01.800
if you want to allow this application to make changes.

03:01.800 --> 03:03.120
We're gonna say Yes,

03:03.120 --> 03:04.740
and we're gonna give this some time

03:04.740 --> 03:08.853
in order to install VMware tools on this virtual machine.

03:10.230 --> 03:12.690
Once the PowerShell blue screen disappears,

03:12.690 --> 03:15.120
it means that everything got installed properly.

03:15.120 --> 03:16.500
And if you look here at the bottom,

03:16.500 --> 03:20.220
you'll see that we have network connection through ethernet,

03:20.220 --> 03:22.440
and that's because this machine is configured

03:22.440 --> 03:25.860
to use the virtual net network that VMware starts.

03:25.860 --> 03:28.080
And I have my virtual machines configured

03:28.080 --> 03:29.520
to get internet access.

03:29.520 --> 03:32.220
And like we said before, this way these machines

03:32.220 --> 03:34.440
think that the host machine is the router

03:34.440 --> 03:38.130
and they connect to the virtual NAT network through it

03:38.130 --> 03:40.410
and get internet access through it.

03:40.410 --> 03:43.743
And to confirm this, we can simply open up a web browser,

03:45.810 --> 03:48.633
get started, and just go to google.com.

03:50.490 --> 03:53.850
And perfect, as you can see, now we have internet access

03:53.850 --> 03:55.263
on this virtual machine.

03:56.610 --> 03:58.650
And we can also go into full screen

03:58.650 --> 04:00.870
by clicking the screen button in here.

04:00.870 --> 04:03.690
The screen will adjust, but sometimes, as you can see,

04:03.690 --> 04:06.660
it's not gonna fully go into the right resolution.

04:06.660 --> 04:07.620
So to fix this,

04:07.620 --> 04:11.250
you can simply right click anywhere on the desktop,

04:11.250 --> 04:13.560
go to the display settings,

04:13.560 --> 04:15.720
and select the resolution that you want.

04:15.720 --> 04:20.361
So in my case, it's the 1920 by 1080, and perfect.

04:20.361 --> 04:24.450
As you can see right now, we got the right resolution.

04:24.450 --> 04:26.040
If you wanna exit the full screen

04:26.040 --> 04:28.920
you can simply just take the mouse to the top

04:28.920 --> 04:33.000
and click the green button, and we are out of it.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.470
And as you can see right now,

04:34.470 --> 04:37.980
we have this Windows machine running as a virtual machine

04:37.980 --> 04:41.370
through VMware inside my Apple silicone computer

04:41.370 --> 04:43.110
alongside my Kali machine,

04:43.110 --> 04:46.890
which we can access in here in the virtual machine library.

04:46.890 --> 04:49.770
So now we can try to hack into this Windows machine

04:49.770 --> 04:53.283
and test attacks against it using the Kali machine.
