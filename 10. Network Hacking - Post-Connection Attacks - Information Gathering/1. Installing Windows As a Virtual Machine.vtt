00:00.420 --> 00:02.310
Instructor: Now to practice some of the attacks

00:02.310 --> 00:05.130
that we're gonna learn in the future lectures,

00:05.130 --> 00:09.060
you need to have a target machine, or a victim machine.

00:09.060 --> 00:12.420
So this is a computer that you're going to target

00:12.420 --> 00:14.610
and try to hack and test the attacks

00:14.610 --> 00:16.503
that we're gonna learn against.

00:17.340 --> 00:19.740
So you can do this against any machine,

00:19.740 --> 00:23.730
but I highly recommend installing target machines

00:23.730 --> 00:25.920
as virtual machines.

00:25.920 --> 00:29.160
This is great because it won't break a real computer for you

00:29.160 --> 00:30.960
if you actually break something.

00:30.960 --> 00:32.820
It's also very easy to fix,

00:32.820 --> 00:35.460
even if you have a computer that you don't care about.

00:35.460 --> 00:37.530
It's very easy to fix virtual machines.

00:37.530 --> 00:39.810
You can just remove it and reinstall it

00:39.810 --> 00:42.093
or store a snapshot and go back to it.

00:43.560 --> 00:44.640
Now, as we all know,

00:44.640 --> 00:47.400
Windows is a very common operating system.

00:47.400 --> 00:49.860
It's used by a lot of people.

00:49.860 --> 00:53.340
So in this video I'm gonna show you how to install Windows

00:53.340 --> 00:57.120
as a virtual machine on all operating systems

00:57.120 --> 00:58.920
so that we can test the attacks

00:58.920 --> 01:01.410
that we're going to learn against it.

01:01.410 --> 01:04.860
If you have an Apple computer that uses an M Chip,

01:04.860 --> 01:07.980
then skip this lecture and watch the next lecture.

01:07.980 --> 01:10.440
That one will show you how to install Windows

01:10.440 --> 01:12.960
on an Apple M computer.

01:12.960 --> 01:15.420
For Windows, Linux, and Apple computers

01:15.420 --> 01:16.950
that use the Intel chip,

01:16.950 --> 01:18.750
you can continue watching this lecture

01:18.750 --> 01:21.660
to learn how to install Windows on it.

01:21.660 --> 01:25.080
Now, Microsoft has released ready virtual images

01:25.080 --> 01:27.180
for people to test windows

01:27.180 --> 01:31.080
so we can actually download a virtual image of Windows

01:31.080 --> 01:33.123
for free from Microsoft.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.520
I'm gonna include the download links

01:35.520 --> 01:37.920
in the resources of this lecture.

01:37.920 --> 01:39.690
Now, I've already done that

01:39.690 --> 01:42.990
and I already have it in here in my downloads.

01:42.990 --> 01:44.640
As you can see, we have it here,

01:44.640 --> 01:47.550
MSEDGE.windows10.VMware.

01:47.550 --> 01:51.360
And as you can see from the icon, this is a zip archive.

01:51.360 --> 01:54.720
Therefore, in order to use the contents inside it,

01:54.720 --> 01:57.510
we have to uncompress this file.

01:57.510 --> 01:59.130
So to do that on Windows,

01:59.130 --> 02:01.383
simply we're gonna have to double click it,

02:02.640 --> 02:04.470
copy the content,

02:04.470 --> 02:08.010
go back one directory and paste it here.

02:08.010 --> 02:11.310
We're gonna give it some time to uncompress the content.

02:11.310 --> 02:13.110
On Mac you can do the same,

02:13.110 --> 02:16.140
simply double click and it will uncompress the content.

02:16.140 --> 02:18.540
And on Linux, you'll have to right click

02:18.540 --> 02:21.270
and click on extract here.

02:21.270 --> 02:24.480
Now I'm doing these steps from a Windows host computer,

02:24.480 --> 02:28.020
but you should be able to follow them on Apple MacOS,

02:28.020 --> 02:30.330
and Linux because we are essentially

02:30.330 --> 02:34.143
using the same virtualization software, which is VMware.

02:35.370 --> 02:36.990
Once this is done, we're gonna have

02:36.990 --> 02:39.570
another directory in here with the contents

02:39.570 --> 02:41.880
of the virtual Windows image.

02:41.880 --> 02:43.800
To import this to VMware,

02:43.800 --> 02:45.993
we're gonna first of all run VMware.

02:47.430 --> 02:50.100
We're gonna click on Open Virtual Machine,

02:50.100 --> 02:53.223
or go to Player, File, Open.

02:54.420 --> 02:56.490
We're gonna navigate to the location

02:56.490 --> 02:58.920
where we have this file in here.

02:58.920 --> 03:02.340
So it's gonna be in my downloads

03:02.340 --> 03:04.830
in MSEdge.windows10.VMware,

03:04.830 --> 03:07.740
and we're gonna select the only file

03:07.740 --> 03:10.620
that we can actually select from the list.

03:10.620 --> 03:12.250
We're gonna click on open

03:13.110 --> 03:15.960
and we can set the name of the machine in here.

03:15.960 --> 03:19.260
So for example, I can set it to Windows 10.

03:19.260 --> 03:21.420
You can change the path where it's gonna be stored,

03:21.420 --> 03:23.370
but we're gonna keep that the same,

03:23.370 --> 03:26.433
and we're gonna click on import to import it.

03:27.300 --> 03:28.950
You're gonna have to give it a bit of time

03:28.950 --> 03:31.653
to import this machine into VMware.

03:33.840 --> 03:34.673
And Perfect.

03:34.673 --> 03:37.260
As you can see now, it's imported in here.

03:37.260 --> 03:39.750
And as usual, we can simply start it

03:39.750 --> 03:42.210
by clicking on the green play button.

03:42.210 --> 03:43.410
But before doing that,

03:43.410 --> 03:47.130
I actually wanna modify the amount of memory it has.

03:47.130 --> 03:50.700
So we're gonna right click and go to settings.

03:50.700 --> 03:52.590
And as you can see by default

03:52.590 --> 03:55.440
it's set to have four gigabytes of memory.

03:55.440 --> 03:57.150
I think that's a little bit too much.

03:57.150 --> 03:58.770
It doesn't need that much.

03:58.770 --> 04:01.080
So we're gonna set that to two

04:01.080 --> 04:03.756
by dragging the slider down to two.

04:03.756 --> 04:06.000
W we're gonna click on okay,

04:06.000 --> 04:09.333
and start it by clicking on the green play button.

04:10.770 --> 04:11.603
And Perfect.

04:11.603 --> 04:14.040
As you can see now, the machine started.

04:14.040 --> 04:19.040
We're gonna click inside and click again to log in.

04:19.080 --> 04:22.863
The default password in here is capital Passw0rd!

04:28.530 --> 04:32.370
I'm gonna hit enter, and here we go.

04:32.370 --> 04:37.320
We have a fully working virtual Windows 10 computer

04:37.320 --> 04:40.830
installed inside our main machine.

04:40.830 --> 04:43.710
and we did that so we can test attacks

04:43.710 --> 04:46.080
against this virtual machine

04:46.080 --> 04:49.230
without affecting our host computer.

04:49.230 --> 04:52.080
Now we can go in full screen by clicking here

04:52.080 --> 04:54.660
and go into full screen.

04:54.660 --> 04:58.050
The screen should automatically resize, if it doesn't,

04:58.050 --> 05:01.590
right click display settings

05:01.590 --> 05:05.220
and you can set it to the right resolution for your screen.

05:05.220 --> 05:09.090
I'm gonna set it to 3840 by 2160

05:09.090 --> 05:12.030
because I have 4K screen,

05:12.030 --> 05:14.700
you can see that the icons are actually really small

05:14.700 --> 05:17.640
because I have such a high resolution screen.

05:17.640 --> 05:19.950
In your case, you'll only face this issue

05:19.950 --> 05:22.200
if you have a 4K screen.

05:22.200 --> 05:24.450
So you'll also probably need to set

05:24.450 --> 05:27.360
the scaling in here to 200.

05:27.360 --> 05:28.530
And as you can see now,

05:28.530 --> 05:32.580
the icon size has changed to the normal size.

05:32.580 --> 05:34.500
Now, if you face any other issues,

05:34.500 --> 05:36.390
check out the featured questions,

05:36.390 --> 05:38.010
and if you don't find an answer,

05:38.010 --> 05:40.920
feel free to ask us and we will respond to you

05:40.920 --> 05:43.323
within a maximum of 15 hours.
